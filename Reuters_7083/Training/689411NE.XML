<p>Hewlett-Packard Co. has unveiled new products and services aimed at persuading distant relatives to share high-resolution photographs over the Internet and then print them out at home.</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard, which made its announcement late Wednesday, is seeking to boost traffic in digital photos that can be sent and received over the Internet, which in turn would stimulate sales of the company's scanners and printers.</p>
<p>&quot;If we can make more kinds of people want to print more things, we're very happy,&quot; HP Internet Technology Officer Ira Goldstein said in an interview.</p>
<p>The technology protocol behind the imaging software for personal computers, called FlashPix, was developed by Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft Corp., Eastman Kodak Co. and private software firm Live Pictures Inc.</p>
<p>Goldstein declined to predict how the plan would affect sales, but said that if, according to industry estimates, 60 billion photos are printed each year and 1 percent of that market went digital, &quot;You're talking about the ability to double Hewlett-Packard's printer business.&quot;</p>
<p>The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company also said it would work with privately held PictureVision Inc. to expand PictureVision's PhotoNet offering, which enables photographers to post pictures on the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>Customers who use PhotoNet get a Web page address and a password when picking up their developed photos. They can then pass the address and password on to friends and family who, if they have a PC and an Internet connection, can view and download the photos. The password insures some measure of privacy.</p>
<p>Besides downloading photographs, PhotoNet allows customers using participating film finishers to zoom in on pictures taken from the Net and crop them.</p>
<p>Goldstein said digital photo scanners could be particularly attractive to educational institutions and to companies that use Internet catalogues to sell their wares.</p>
<p>&quot;Much of Internet commerce depends on being able to see what you buy,&quot; Goldstein said. He added that pictures of digitally scanned merchandise could give online shoppers the ability to zoom in on stones in a necklace or other such details that would otherwise be impossible to see.</p>
<p>The HP PhotoSmart scanner and high-resolution printer are both priced at just under $500, Goldstein said.</p>
