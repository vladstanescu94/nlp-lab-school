<p>Market research firm International Data Corp (IDC) projects worldwide personal computer unit shipments next year will rise 16.6 percent to 81.1 million after rising 18.5 percent to 69.5 million in 1996.</p>
<p>IDC analysts told the firm's PC Market Outlook conference here that a sluggish European market and moderation in U.S. market growth, along with the challenge of gaining mass market appeal for the PC, would be dampenning factors for 1997 growth.</p>
<p>Key worldwide accelerators of growth are the booming market in Japan and the Asia Pacific region, the shift to high-end Intel Pentium Pro and Microsoft Windows NT systems, the Internet and multimedia advances.</p>
<p>Europe PC unit shipments are expected to grow 10.9 percent this year to 16.6 million units, and by a slower 9.5 percent to 18.2 million next year.</p>
<p>By contrast, PC shipments in the Asia Pacific region excluding Japan is seen surging 29.8 percent to 8.8 million in 1996 and 24.8 percent to 10.9 million next year.</p>
<p>Japan's market is expected to more than double this year, with PC unit sales to rise 131.1 percent to 8.4 million units, with no projection released for 1997.</p>
<p>The rate of growth in PC shipments in Latin America is expected to increase, according to IDC, rising 21 percent in 1996 to 2.8 million units, with 1997 shipments to rise 22.3 percent to 3.4 million.</p>
<p>The Mediterranean, Middle East and Africa and the East Central Europe are expected to grow 13.2 percent and 17.4 percent this year, an IDC analyst said.</p>
<p>IDC said Compaq Computer Corp is the largest vendor worldwide by first half unit shipments, with around 10 percent of the market, followed by International Business Machines Corp, Apple Computer Inc, Packard Bell, and Packard Bell parent NEC Corp's separate PC business unit.</p>
<p>Sixth in world unit share rankings for the first six months of 1996 was Hewlett-Packard Co, followed by Dell, Fujitsu Ltd-ICL, Toshiba and Acer, IDC found.</p>
<p>IDC said Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Toshiba and Fujitsu are positioned as the strongest PC players worldwide, while Apple was &quot;still on defensive&quot; during a tough year, as the company struggles to redurn to profitability.</p>
