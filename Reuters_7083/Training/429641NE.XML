<p>It's a bit of a stretch: A value fund in the fast-paced world of science and technology stocks.</p>
<p>How do you find cheap stocks among those bullets that are the favorites of momentum investors and growth fund managers?</p>
<p>But Ken Kam, co-portfolio manager of Interactive Investments's Technology Value Fund, insists the two philosphies can co-exist. &quot;When you're investing in high tech, the PE (price earnings ratio) is not necessarily the best measure,&quot; said Kam.  </p>
<p>&quot;What we mean by value is having to see a reason to believe that a stock can double in two years,&quot; Kam said.  &quot;The underlying fundamentals in a company's competitive (situation) we believe are enough to double market cap in two years.&quot;</p>
<p>Kam believes that being based, along with co-manager Kevin Landis, in Silicon Valley is an advantage in building relationships within the technology and medical industries and keeping up on developments.</p>
<p>Kam and Landis seek out companies that have come up with good products that are well accepted within their industries.  </p>
<p>The philosophy appears to have been working.  According to Lipper Analytical Services, the fund it was rated first among 39 science and technology funds for the 12 months ended February.  Technology Value returned 48.96 percent compared with an average return of 12.11 percent for the sector.</p>
<p>Year to date, the fund, started in May 1994, was off 1.65 percent, while the average dropped 1.17 percent.</p>
<p>The $55 million fund owns 42 securities, with only two percent in cash.  Since the end of 1996, its managers have doubled the exposure in medical stocks to 25 percent from 12.5 percent.  The rest is in technology stocks.  </p>
<p>The top holding is Cisco Systems Inc at 7.4 percent.  &quot;Most people have concluded that the big companies in computer networking have already gotten so big that they can't see another doubling in market caps or market sizes.  We think that's just wrong,&quot; said Kam.</p>
<p>He argued that demand for router products made by Cisco and Ascend Communications Inc -- another big holding at 6.59 percent -- should increase at a huge rate as more people want sound and video capabilities on the Internet.</p>
<p>Another top issue is Sierra Semiconductor Corp at 6.62 percent.  </p>
<p>Kam likes Lattice Semiconductor Corp, the fourth largest holding at 5.59 percent.  He cites the maker of programmable logic devices because &quot;its business model fits well with the needs of most manufacturers of consumer electronic products.&quot;</p>
<p>As the life cycle of new products extends to about 18 months, Kam said, companies &quot;don't have time to make the integrated circuits for products.&quot;  Companies like Lattice make the chips that help get products like cordless phones and speaker phones to market faster.  </p>
<p>The fifth biggest holding is Intel Corp at 5.55 percent.  Kam said the fund bought most of its stake during the Pentium scare in 1995.</p>
<p>In the sixth position is in IKOS Systems Inc at 4.75 percent, and seventh place is held by Avanti Corp at 3.62 percent.</p>
<p>On the medical side, Kam is very bullish on three companies involved in cardio-vascular devices:  Arterial Vascular Engineering Inc ; Endosonics Corp ; and Cardiometrics Inc.  </p>
<p>What's common to all three companies, Kam said, is that they have turned the corner on market acceptance of their products.</p>
<p>Arterial Vascular, for example, makes cardiac stents, the little springs that cardiologists release in human arteries that physically hold the vessels open so blood can flow.  Uses have extended beyond emergency rooms.  He expects the company to launch the stents next year in the United States after receiving U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.</p>
<p>Arterial's stents are number two to Johnson and Johnson's in the industry, Kam said, and he expects the U.S. will be a huge potential market for Arterial.</p>
<p>Endosonics makes intravascular ultrasound catheters that allow cardiologists to determine whether stents are working properly.</p>
