<p>Japanese software house ASCII Corp said on  Friday that it would post an extraordinary loss of about 3.8 billion  yen due mainly to losses at two of its affiliates.  </p>
<p>A company spokesman said that it had decided to write off its 2.14  billion yen stake in Crosspoint Solutions Inc of the United States  in the current business year to March 31, 1998.</p>
<p>The California-based firm, which develops and markets special types  of integrated circuits, has debts in excess of its assets, ASCII said  in a statement.</p>
<p>The Japanese firm said it had also decided to post losses totalling  1.03 billion yen from selling its stake in International Datacasting  Crop of Canada as well as from writing off loans to the Canadian firm  in the current business year.</p>
<p>The firm, which makes and sells data-transferring devices for satellite  telecommunications, also has debts exceeding its assets, the statement  said.</p>
<p>ASCII said it would post losses totalling 683 million yen in 1997/98  from selling shares it holds in a Japanese firm as well as by giving  up loans to the firm.</p>
<p>It said it would sell part of its securities holdings to cover for  the losses and maintain its forecast for the current business year  ending on March 31, 1998.</p>
