<p>Avant! Corp's current quarter is going &quot;extremely well&quot; despite criminal and shareholder lawsuits against the engineering software company, Chief Executive Gerald Hsu said Friday.</p>
<p>Avant!, which writes software to help electrical engineers design computer chips, also will announce more major deals in coming months, following a long-term contract with Lucent Technologies Inc announced today.</p>
<p>&quot;Our second-quarter is going extremely, extremely stong,&quot; Hsu said in an emotional conference call.  </p>
<p>&quot;This shows the customers' strong commitment, even after this legal action. The customers are no fools. They demonstrate their confidence with us. They demonstrate it in the best way -- with their pocket books,&quot; Hsu said.</p>
<p>In April, Hsu and other Avant! executives were charged with alleged conspiracy and theft of trade secrets from Cadence Design Systems Inc, a bitter rival. Avant!'s stock plunged 50 percent then on concerns that customers would be scared away.  </p>
<p>As a measure of Avant!'s strong business, Hsu said during the conference all that, at the going pace, he expects Avant! to have $600,000 in bookings per employee by the end of the year. Intel, he said, had $520,000 in bookings per employee per year.</p>
<p>&quot;We were managing for the past year $500,000,&quot; he said. &quot;this year we are approaching $600,000 per employee per year.&quot;</p>
<p>Hsu also reiterated he will not resign, despite criminal charges against him.</p>
<p>&quot;The charges are false, and I'm not going to leave, period.&quot;</p>
<p>Trading of Avant!'s stock had been halted before the announcements were made. Its shares rose 3-7/8 to 25 on Nasdaq trading of 1.14 million shares.</p>
