<headline>Policy Management enters SEC settlement.</headline>
<dateline>COLUMBIA, S.C. 1997-07-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Policy Management Systems Corp said on Tuesday that it reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that closes the investigation of the company's 1990 to 1993 financial statements and reports.</p>
<p>In consenting to the settlement, Policy Management neither admitted nor denied the SEC allegations of reporting, books and records, and internal control violations.  </p>
<p>Provisions of the settlement include an injunction requiring compliance with federal securities laws, a $1 million civil penalty and payments by five current and former officers of $20,000 each in civil penalties, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>The settlement became effective today when it was filed simultaneously with an SEC complaint in federal court, the company said.</p>
<p>Issues related to the company's accounting from 1990 to 1993 arose after a period in which Policy Management made several acquisitions, the company said.</p>
<p>Policy Management said it cooperated fully with the investigation and also conducted its own exhaustive review and re-audit of its reported results for 1990 through 1993.</p>
<p>As previously disclosed in 1994, the review and re-audit resulted in adjustments primarily related to the timing of revenue and expense recognition.</p>
<p>Policy Management said 1990 and 1991 earnings were unchanged after the review, but there was an upward restatement of 1992 earnings per share from $2.55 to $2.65.</p>
