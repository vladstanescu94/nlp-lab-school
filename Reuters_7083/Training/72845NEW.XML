<p>The one word that might sum up many of the toys and other items in demand this coming holiday season is gross! In child-speak, that translates into the delight of bubbling brains, slime and rubber chickens.</p>
<p>From Pressman Toy Corp. comes the Domino Rally Mad Lab Set, the newest addition to the Domino Rally series. Here, tumbling dominoes set off a series of events that culminate with, you've got it, bubbling brains.</p>
<p>Starting with the eerie eyeball, the falling dominoes trigger an oozing tongue from the head of the Mad Scientist, then go to the cauldron and the aforementioned grand finale.</p>
<p>The Domino Rally Mad Lab Set comes with 200 dominoes and accessories. It is recommended for ages six and up. It sells for about $25.95.</p>
<p>For more information, contact Pressman Toy Corp. in New York at 212-675-7910.</p>

<p>For an extreme in outdoor activities, Mad River Rocket Co. Inc., a Vermont-based company, has developed the Extreme Sled.</p>
<p>It works like skis and snowboards, except it is contoured for the whole body, not just the feet. The rider kneels on the sled to manoeuvre it down a snowy hill.</p>
<p>The Extreme Sled's low centre of gravity allows for quick runs down the slopes. It is currently being introduced into major toy stores nationwide. It costs about $49.95.</p>
