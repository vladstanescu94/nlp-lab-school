<p>Microsoft Corp. Friday completed the $425 million acquisition of WebTV Networks Inc. after the Justice Department said it had no objection to the deal.</p>
<p>The acquisition is by far the biggest ever completed by the software giant, reflecting a huge bet by Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates that he can extend his dominance beyond computing into television as the two industries converge.</p>
<p>In another effort to speed that convergence, Microsoft invested $1 billion -- its largest single investment -- for an 11.5 percent stake in cable operator Comcast Corp. in June.</p>
<p>In a brief statement, the Justice Department said the WebTV deal would not violate federal antitrust laws because there are so many companies competing or planning to compete with WebTV, which provides Internet service through television set-top boxes.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumers will have lots of choices when it comes to Internet TV devices, so we're going to be working around the clock to make our products the best choice,&quot; said Craig Mundie, senior vice president for Microsoft's consumer platforms division.</p>
<p>Mundie said future versions of WebTV will incorporate the Windows CE operating system, a version of Windows 95 currently used mostly in hendheld devices.</p>
<p>WebTV will be operated as a subsidiary based in Palo Alto, Calif., with co-founder Steve Perlman retaining his title as chief executive officer. The company has nearly 400 employees.</p>
<p>Perlman said this week he expects the service to reach 250,000 subscribers by the end of the year, more than double the current number of users.</p>
<p>Over the years the Justice Department has conducted several investigations involving Microsoft and still has under way a long-running probe of its Internet software business.</p>
<p>The WebTV deal drew opposition from several Microsoft rivals, who argued the deal would increase Microsoft's ability to dominate access to the Internet.</p>
<p>In May the Justice Department requested additional information about the deal, but it finally closed the probe after what it called a &quot;thorough investigation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The investigation confirmed that a number of other companies, several of whom are significant participants in the computer or consumer electronics industries, have or will soon enter the market with competitive products and alternative technologies,&quot; the department said.</p>
<p>While the acquisition is the biggest Microsoft has completed, it is far from the biggest it has ever attempted.</p>
<p>In 1995 Microsoft called off its planned $2.3 billion acquisition of financial software maker Intuit Inc. after the Justice Department moved to block the merger on antitrust grounds.</p>
<p>Microsoft's stock fell 75 cents to close at $140.625 on Nasdaq.</p>
