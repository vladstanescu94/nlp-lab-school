<p>Adobe Systems Inc. said Tuesday that profits jumped 35 percent in its first quarter, much better than Wall Street expected, on strong sales of its graphics editing software.</p>
<p>The company, based in San Jose, Calif., also said it plans to pay a dividend based on the money it has made from investing in other public companies. Adobe runs a venture capital operation that has invested in many Silicon Valley companies including Netscape Communications Corp.</p>
<p>For the quarter ended Feb. 28, Adobe's profit from operations rose to $45.4 million, or 61 cents a share, from $33.7 million, or 44 cents a share. With a one-time gain, the company had net income of $46.5 million, or 63 cents a share, in the latest quarter.</p>
<p>Analysts expected Adobe, the third-biggest personal computer software company, to earn 51 cents a share, according to Zacks Investment Research, which tracks estimates.</p>
<p>Revenue rose 17 percent to $226.5 million from $193.6 million.</p>
<p>Adobe writes computer programmes that help graphic artists design publications and produce illustrations. Revenue from applications, aided by the recent release of a new version of its flagship PageMaker product, rose to $175 million in the quarter from $146.7 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Adobe also runs an operation that invests in technology startups. Some of those startups, including Netscape, have gone public, which has sent $72.6 million in cash to Adobe's coffers.</p>
<p>Adobe said it will distribute some of that profit it its investors from time to time in a special dividend, pending board approval. The first dividend could be paid within a few months, the company said.</p>
