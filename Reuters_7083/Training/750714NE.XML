<p>German software group SAP AG said on Wednesday it would in future be led by two management board chairmen with the current deputy stepping up to share the top post.</p>
<p>SAP said in a statement that Hasso Plattner, deputy management board chairman, would join Dietmar Hopp as a co-chairman of the company in a move necessitated by SAP's rapid growth and expansion overseas.  </p>
<p>Calling Plattner his close friend, Hopp said the move to a &quot;two-chairmen&quot; management structure suited SAP's corporate culture and its &quot;flat&quot; chain of command.</p>
<p>SAP also said in the statement that pre-tax profit soared 56 percent to 582 million marks during the first half of this year while sales during the same period climbed 51 percent to 2.4 billion marks.</p>
<p>The company, a favorite among American investors, also said it would not list its shares in the U.S. any earlier than the end of 1998.</p>
<p>The company had previously reported that profit growth would be similar to the first quarter's 54 percent growth rate.</p>
<p>In the first quarter, SAP benefitted from the strength of the dollar as about a third of its sales are from the U.S. market.</p>
<p>The dollar now stands at an eight-year high of around 1.83 marks, even higher than the 1.67 rate at the end of the first quarter.</p>
