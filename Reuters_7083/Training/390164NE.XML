<p>On June 28, 1996, the Company completed an acquisition with Abalon AB (&quot;Abalon&quot;).</p>
<p>On February 27, 1996, the Company completed a merger with Bendata, Inc. (&quot;Bendata&quot;).</p>
<p>(2) In connection with the Bendata merger, $3,416,000 of merger expenses ($2,609,000 after-tax) were incurred and charged to expense in the first quarter of 1996.  The merger expenses consisted of merger related bonus payments made to Bendata non-shareholder employees as well as legal, accounting and investment banking fees. (3) In connection with the Abalon purchase, the Company recorded approximately $13.8 million of the purchase price as a charge to expense on the acquisition date as it was related to the fair value of incomplete research and development projects. (4) During the first seven months of 1995 for Astea and the full year of 1995 for Bendata, they were taxed under subchapter S of the Internal revenue code, therefore, income taxes includes a provision for certain states which do not recognize S-corporation status. Income taxes for the first quarter of 1996 includes a charge of $575,000 for the reinstatement of a deferred income tax liability for Bendata caused by the termination of Bendata's S corporation status as a result of the merger.  Excluding this charge, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $267,000 for the last quarter of 1996, or an effective tax rate of 15.5%.  This income tax benefit was reduced due to the non-deductibility of certain merger expenses.</p>
