<p>An alliance of computer software producers said on Wednesday it had identified about 100 companies using pirated software in Egypt and its lawyers were sending out letters asking them to clean up their act.</p>
<p>The Business Software Alliance (BSA), a lobbying group financed mainly by the big software producers, told a news conference that this was its second big initiative in Egypt, where it believes at least 80 percent of software is pirated.</p>
<p>The software companies could be losing about $80 million a year from copyright infringement in Egypt, BSA officials said.</p>
<p>In an earlier initiative launched in November last year, the alliance helped bring about legal action against 31 Egyptian companies alleged to be retailing pirated software.</p>
<p>Two civil suits have been settled out of court and appeal courts have ruled in favour of the software companies in four criminal cases. The other cases are in preliminary stages.</p>
<p>Sherin El Rayes, the BSA chairman in Egypt, said the legal actions had already had a deterrent effect. &quot;The situation is very much improving but it's too early to quantify,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mohammed El-Berry, BSA's lawyer in Egypt, said the letters to the 100 software users were the first stage in a process which could end in prosecution.</p>
<p>&quot;The letters will alert them to the existence of illegal software (in their companies), because the executives may not be aware of this, and ask them to do something about it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If they do not act, then a hard warning letter will follow, saying action may be taken if they continue,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The 100 companies are large to medium sized and operate a minimum of 25 personal computers each, the official said. They include public-sector companies but not government departments.</p>
<p>Berry said that under Egyptian law copyright violations were a misdemeanour for which the courts would often impose a fine of about 5,000 pounds ($1,500). Imprisonment is mandatory for second-time offenders, he added.</p>
<p>For software piracy the courts have awarded software companies nominal preliminary damages of 501 pounds ($150) but so far no amounts beyond that, he said.</p>
<p>The BSA officials said copyright protection would also benefit Egypt's fledgling software industry, which is exporting programmes worth only $10 million a year, compared to $240 million by Israel and $1 billion by India.</p>
