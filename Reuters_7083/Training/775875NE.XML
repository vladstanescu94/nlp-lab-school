<title>USA: Cisco quarterly earnings expected to rise 34 percent.</title>

<p>Cisco Systems Inc. is expected to report Tuesday that its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings jumped 34 percent on strong sales of its computer networking gear, analysts said.</p>
<p>The world's biggest maker of networking equipment also is expected to report a revenue increase of about 36 percent. Its results are expected after the close of stock market.</p>
<p>The growth of the once red-hot market for networking gear is slowing, but Cisco likely will continue to thrive as competitors such as Bay Networks Inc. and Cabletron Systems Inc. struggle, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Cisco will probably exceed expectations modestly,&quot; said Gina Sockolow, networking analyst at investment bank Schroder Wertheim &amp; Co. in New York. &quot;They'll claim market share gain from Bay Network's stumble and from Cabletron's recent stumble.&quot;</p>
<p>Cisco also is doing a good job of managing a tricky transition to new technology. Many of its large customers, which include the world's biggest companies, are replacing older devices called routers with speedy and cheaper devices called switches. The transition to switching gear is squeezing the profits of networking companies, but not Cisco's.</p>
<p>&quot;Their switching gross margins are better than expected,&quot; said Martin Pyykkonen, analyst at Furman Selz in San Francisco. &quot;Switching is a key growth element for them.&quot;</p>
<p>Wall Street expects Cisco, based in Santa Clara, Calif., to report earnings per share of 55 cents a share, according to a recent survey of analysts by Zacks Investment Research. Revenue forecasts range from $1.76 billion to $1.8 billion.</p>
<p>In the same quarter a year ago, Cisco reported net income of $276.6 million, or 41 cents a share, on revenue of $1.29 billion.</p>
<p>Cisco also has told Wall Street that it expects a strong fall quarter, Sockolow said.</p>
<p>The company's growth prospects have boosted its stock in recent weeks. In late afternoon Nasdaq trading, Cisco shares were up $2 at $81.8125, the all-time high.</p>
