<title>USA: Intuit to give away some tax software.</title>
<headline>Intuit to give away some tax software.</headline>
<dateline>MENLO PARK, Calif. 1997-01-17</dateline>

<p>Intuit Inc said Monday it plans to give away a simple version of its tax preparation software through the Internet, in hopes of attracting paying customers for its full-function products.</p>
<p>Intuit, publisher of the Quicken personal finance program and the TurboTax tax preparation software, said it will offer a program that will help people file a 1040EZ tax return, the basic form about 20 million people use each year.</p>
<p>The strategy is similar to the way vendors of video games, such as Doom and Duke Nukem, get their customers hooked. They offer the first few levels of the games for free on the Internet. Customers have to pay the full retail price to get the rest of the game.</p>
<p>&quot;We have targeted university students with this product,&quot; said Russ Sprouse, product manager for online tax preparation at Intuit. &quot;When they get out of college and become professionals, we expect them to be in the mindset to look at our products.&quot;</p>
<p>Sprouse said he does not expect the strategy to affect the company's revenue this year. &quot;The intent really is to get our presence known,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's certainly a novel marketing strategy,&quot; said Scott Smith, director of digital commerce research at Jupiter Communications LLC in New York. &quot;This is a good way to draw new users to the product line.&quot;</p>
<p>Intuit said the TurboTax 1040EZ product will be available at its tax center web site on Friday.</p>
