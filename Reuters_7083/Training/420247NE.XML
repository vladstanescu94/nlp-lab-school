<headline>Broderbund tumbles after Q2 profit warning.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-05</dateline>

<p>Shares in Broderbund Software Inc tumbled over 20 percent on Wednesday after the company warned its second quarter profits would come in well below analysts' forecasts.</p>
<p>Lehman Brothers, Alex. Brown and Morgan Stanley downgraded their ratings on Broderbund's shares following the news, issued after the stock market's close Tuesday.</p>
<p>The stock was off 7-1/8 to 23-3/8 in morning trading.</p>
<p>Novato, Calif-based software company said it expects to report second quarter earnings of between $0.15 and $0.20 a share, excluding charges.  </p>
<p>The consensus Wall Street estimate for the company's second quarter was $0.31 a share, according to First Call.</p>
<p>Broderbund said that while unit volume was up over 30 percent for the quarter, results were hurt by reduced prices. It said it would release its second quarter results the market's close March 20.</p>
<p>Lehman analyst Michael Stanek cut his earnings estimate on Broderbund's fiscal year ending August 31, 1997 to $1.03 from $1.48 a share, and dropped fiscal 1998 to $1.46 from $1.75. He downgraded the stock to neutral from buy and set a 12-month price target on the stock of $30.</p>
<p>Broderbund shares' 52-week high is 49-1/4.</p>
<p>&quot;The shortfall was due primarily to lower gross margins caused by aggressive price reductions,&quot; Stanek said in a report.</p>
<p>The company's strategy worked in December as robust unit volume growth compensated for lower gross margins, the analyst said. But volumes in January and February were &quot;off significantly,&quot; he said.</p>
