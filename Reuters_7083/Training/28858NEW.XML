<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Oracle active ahead of meeting.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-09-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Oracle Corp options were active on the Chicago Board Options Exchange ahead of a meeting on Wednesday between the company's chairman and securities analysts.</p>
<p>&quot;The chairman is speaking tomorrow and there's a lot of speculation back and forth on the puts,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>He added that one customer bought 5,000 out-of-the-money Oracle calls.</p>
<p>That option, the September 40 call, traded more than 7,300 contracts by afternoon. It was up 1/8 at 1/2. Its open interest through last Friday was 19,853.  </p>
<p>Tuesday afternoon, Oracle shares were ahead 1-5/8 at 36-7/8 on heavy turnover of more than four million shares.</p>
<p>Joseph Sunderman at Investment Research Institute in Cincinnati said investors have been adding September 40 calls since late August when the stock fell back below the key 40 level after punching through it earlier in the month.</p>
<p>&quot;When it fell back down, a lot of calls were being purchased at the 40 strike,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of speculative buyers thought it would be a great opportunity to get back into this momentum and they've really been wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said Tuesday's action was primarily institutional.  </p>
<p>Sunderman said put activity had been quiet as the stock declined from its 42-1/8 peak reached on August 8.</p>
<p>The lack of put activity on the stock's decline and the high open interest on the September 40 calls were bearish indications, he said.</p>
<p>Active Oracle puts on Tuesday included the September 35, which traded 1,776 by afternoon. The option, which had an open interest of 8,994 through last Friday when 3,123 contracts were added, was down 5/8 at one.</p>
<p>The Oracle October 30 put traded 1,035 contracts and the October 35 put traded nearly 1,800.  </p>
<p>In other activity, several calls on shares of Allergan Inc were active amid speculation about a possible merger, traders said.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, merger talks between Allergan and Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Inc fell through, but traders said speculation about some deal remained high.</p>
<p>Barron's magazine reported on Tuesday that Allergan call volume last week was unusually heavy, a sign of possible insider trading.  </p>
<p>The magazine noted that the Allergan October 35 calls were particularly active, and had an open interest of 13,990 contracts. It added that open interest in the Allergan October 40 call was 4,338 and 3,932 for the October 45.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Allergan October 35 call traded 2,455 contracts. With the stock losing 3/4 to 38-1/8, the October 35 call fell 7/8 to four.</p>
<p>The October 40 call traded 1,414 contracts while the September 40 call traded 1,000.</p>
<p>A total of 27 Allergan puts traded. --G. Crawford, 312 408-8750/E-mail: derivatives@reuters.com</p>
