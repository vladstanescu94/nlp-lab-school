<headline>OneWave to lay off 45, executives resign.</headline>
<dateline>WATERTOWN, Mass. 1997-06-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>OneWave Inc on Monday said it plans to cut its workforce by about 45 employees, and its chairman and chief executive officer and chief financial officer have resigned.</p>
<p>OneWave said that the resignation of chairman and chief executive Klaus Besier and chief financial officer Mark Gallagher were effective immediately and came as the company announced that privately held Avix Ventures LP has completed the acquisition of a majority interest in OneWave.</p>
<p>Lennart Mengwall has been named chairman and and Kevin Azzouz has been appointed acting chief executive officer.  </p>
<p>Mengwall and Kevin Azzouz are the principals of Avix, a venture capital firm focusing on technology-related investments.</p>
<p>In conjunction with Besier's departure and pursuant to agreements between the company and Besier, OneWave has received from Besier 960,000 OneWave shares in satisfaction of a $2.5 million loan made by the company.</p>
<p>The company said it expects to incur an as yet undetermined charge related to these matters.</p>
<p>A company spokesman was not immediately available to say how many employees in total work for OneWave or provide further details.</p>
<p>On May 2, Avix said it would buy 7.75 million common shares of OneWave, an Internet software and services company, for $8 million. The shares represent 51.7 percent of OneWave's outstanding stock.</p>
