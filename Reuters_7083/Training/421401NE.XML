<p>Microsoft Corp chairman Bill Gates said on Wednesday that infrastructure improvements were crucial to India's plans to emerge as a software superpower in the next century.</p>
<p>Gates told a meeting of the heads of 500 Indian software firms in Bombay, India's commercial capital, that he wanted to exploit their employees' skills.</p>
<p>&quot;India has what it takes to participate in, even to shape, the future if it makes the necessary investments now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It must build a national telecommunications infrastructure, develop a robust domestic software industry, provide Internet connectivity for the consumer and invest in education.&quot;</p>
<p>Thousands of Indian software engineers see Gates as a success story to emulate in a high-growth industry.</p>
<p>India's software industry, which reported sales worth $1.2 billion in 1995/96 (April-March), expects to grow by 50 percent to $1.8 billion in the 1996/97 fiscal year that ends this month.</p>
<p>The Microsoft chief, who arrived in New Delhi on Monday at the start of a four-day visit, has had meetings with Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and Finance Minister P. Chidambaram.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe we are poised for a quantum jump in terms of using information technology as a tool for the uplift of the large masses of our people,&quot; Deve Gowda said in reply to Gates' remarks at another function later.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda said the government was planning a comprehensive manpower development programme for software exports, as well as mass awareness programmes about the information technology revolution.</p>
<p>&quot;We will intensify efforts to attract foreign investors into India,&quot; Deve Gowda added.</p>
<p>Gates, who owns 25 percent of Microsoft, said his company was committed to establishing India as a global pool of talent and resources in computer software.</p>
<p>&quot;The investment we're going to make here is going to continue to grow and grow,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He chalked out a strategy for Indian software firms, advising them to graduate from doing essentially project-based development to selling their own packaged products, and to develop applications for local markets to meet local needs.</p>
<p>Gates urged the software chiefs to invest in research and development -- an area in which his own firm plans to invest $2 billion this year -- as well as make use of the Internet to market their products globally.</p>
