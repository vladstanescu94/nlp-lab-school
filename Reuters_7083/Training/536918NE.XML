<headline>Softbank profit grows as U.S. units shine.</headline>

<p>Japan's Softbank Corp., an aggressively expanding software and publishing house, showed strong growth in its financial results in the last business year, thanks to healthly earnings at its U.S. subsidiaries such as Ziff-Davis Publishing.</p>
<p>The good news was expected to continue in the current year as well, with U.S. acquisitions again putting in a robust performance.</p>
<p>Softbank, led by one of Japan's most charismatic entrepreneurs, Thursday announced company sales of 359.74 billion yen ($2.85 billion) in the year ended March 31, more than double the previous year's sales.</p>
<p>Company current profit was up 94 percent to 27.88 billion yen ($221 million) in 1996-97. Current profit is pretax and includes losses or gains on investments.</p>
<p>&quot;In short, we can call this fabulous,&quot; Softbank President Masayoshi Son told a news conference Thursday. &quot;We are seeing increasing contribution from our overseas operations.&quot;</p>
<p>Son said operating profits at Softbank's subsidiaries outside Japan accounted for 75 percent of total group profit. The ratio was up from 48.9 percent the previous year.</p>
<p>The weak yen also aided the company's earnings, as it raised the value of dollar-based U.S. assets, he said.</p>
<p>Since September 1994, Softbank has invested nearly 500 billion yen ($3.96 billion) in information-related U.S. businesses such as the Comdex industry trade show and Ziff-Davis Publishing, a major publisher of computer magazines. Son said the value of these investments had risen 20 percent in yen terms as of March.</p>
<p>On a parent basis, the company's sales grew 40 percent to 196.83 billion yen ($1.56 billion) and its current profit rose 79 percent to 23.41 billion yen ($185 million) in 1996-97.</p>
<p>Softbank also expects handsome growth in its earnings in the current business year, which began April 1, as the U.S. units contribute more to profits. It forecast a company profit of 35 billion yen ($277 million) for 1997-98.</p>
<p>Son said Softbank aims to register the shares of some of its U.S. subsidiaries on the Nasdaq market in New York in the next few years.</p>
<p>It also plans to take another two of its Japanese subsidiaries public in 1998, in addition to Yahoo! Japan and other units it has already said it will list this year and next.</p>
