<title>USA: Businesses flock to intranets.</title>

<p>Surfing the Internet may be the coolest recreation around, but in the work-a-day world businesses are flocking to intranets.</p>
<p>The more serious offspring of the flamboyant Internet, intranets are corporate networks built with the same software standards. But they are where the big money is being made by virtually any company in the Internet market.</p>
<p>&quot;Intranets -- business to business communications -- this is where the money is,&quot; said John Warnock, chief executive officer for Adobe Systems Inc., a Mountain View, California, software firm whose growth is now coming from corporate publishing on intranets.</p>
<p>James Clark, chairman of Netscape Communications Corp., a company known for the popularity of its Internet browser, echoed Warnock's assessment.</p>
<p>&quot;More business opportunities than we can possibly handle are coming from the business side,&quot; he said. Netscape gets 80 percent of its sales from business intranets, said Clark.</p>
<p>By using the openness of Internet-style networks and adding security layers and software for managing information flow, companies can share information with employees and selected outsiders, such as distributors, on everything from employee benefits to product designs and pricing.</p>
<p>They find intranets speed up decision-making and boost productivity.</p>
<p>For instance Chrysler Corp. has just entered a multi-million dollar contract with Netscape for 6,000 copies of its server software, license to use its browser worldwide and consulting services for a corporate intranet.</p>
<p>Susan Unger, Chrysler's executive director of information services, said the plan is to connect not only Chrysler's tens of thousands of employees worldwide, but also suppliers and auto dealerships.</p>
<p>This year corporations are allocating &quot;enormous budgets&quot; to building in-house intranets, said venture capitalist John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers.</p>
<p>A survey by Network World magazine and International Data Corp. found that 89 percent of large corporations are building intranets this year, spending an average $2.6 million.</p>
<p>In Silicon Valley dozens of companies hoping to cash in on the intranet craze are publicising &quot;intranet strategies&quot; and customising products for intranets.</p>
<p>According to Zona Research Inc, sales this year of software and hardware just for intranet servers -- the computers that host Web sites -- are nearly three times sales of such software and hardware for Internet servers, at $2.6 billion compared with $979 million.</p>
<p>That's because the wild and anarchistic nature of the Internet -- in which anybody can participate and security is lax -- won't do for most business intranet users.</p>
<p>Consequently, one of the hottest intranet markets is for security and encryption software to create a barrier between a corporate intranet and the Internet.</p>
<p>The lure and promise of intranets comes partly from the shortfalls of its predecessor, client-server computer networks.</p>
<p>Corporations spent huge sums to build client-server networks, putting a PC on every desk and connecting them on local area networks (LAN). These systems allow co-workers on the same LAN to collaborate and e-mail each other.</p>
<p>But typically LANS cannot communicate with others' LANS. because they have been built separately. The result is often that people within one company cannot share information.</p>
<p>&quot;Before intranets, there were islands of information,&quot; said Andy Grove, chief executive officer of Intel Corp. Within Intel for example, there were separate networks for order entry, manufacturing, materials management, finance and information management, he said.</p>
<p>Intel converted all its stand-alone networks to one intranet, Grove said. The result is less complexity, low training costs and employee access to information needed.</p>
<p>Gartner Group estimated last April that the cost of owning and maintaining each desktop PC in a client-server LAN network is about $12,000 a year. The report is often quoted among companies peddling intranet services and equipment.</p>
<p>Intranets can erase much of the administrative cost, analysts say, because information can be posted on internal Web sites for any authorised employee to see.</p>
