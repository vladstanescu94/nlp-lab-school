<p>Astea International Inc said Monday that it will report a loss, including a restructuring charge, for the first quarter 1997 of $12 million to $16 million, or $0.91 to $1.24 per share.</p>
<p>The restructuring charge, which will include severance costs, office closing costs and other consolidation costs, is expected to be in the range of $5 to $8 million, or $0.38 to $0.61 per share, the company said.</p>
<p>Wall Street had expected the company to report a loss of $0.05 per share for the quarter, according to First Call consensus estimates.  </p>
<p>The company said the restructuring will focus its resources on its support and sales automation product lines.</p>
<p>&quot;While the Company intends to maintain its core competency in service automation, this restructuring is intended to focus the company's resources on its support and sales automation product lines, both of which were acquired in 1996, and continue to implement the Company's overall strategy,&quot; the company said in a statement.  </p>
<p>&quot;We feel these actions are necessary to better position the company for the long-term, provide greater value for our shareholders, and reduce our expenses which will allow us to achieve more acceptable levels of performance throughout the remainder of 1997 and beyond,&quot; the company said in a release.</p>
<p>It said it would release first quarter earnings the week of April 21.</p>
<p>Astea International develops and supplies client/server customer interaction software.</p>
