<p>Intuit Inc., looking for ways to expand its financial services on the Internet, agreed to pay $40 million to buy a 19 percent stake in Internet search site operator Excite Inc.</p>
<p>The companies also entered a seven-year agreement to develop sites on the Internet's World Wide Web where customers can get financial news and information to manage their finances.</p>
<p>Under terms of the agreement, Intuit will buy 2.9 million shares of Excite, or about 19 percent of Excite's shares outstanding, at $13.50 a share.</p>
<p>The companies announced the agreement after the market closed, but Excite's stock had jumped $2.25, or 17 percent, to close at $15.375. Intuit shares closed down 50 cents at $24.50.</p>
<p>Intuit is best known for Quicken, the best-selling electronic personal finance programme. In the past year, the Mountain View, California, company has set up financial services on the Internet to wean itself from its flagging software business. The company also has a site that helps customers buy insurance policies.</p>
<p>Excite, based in Redwood City, Calif., operates Web sites that help Internet surfers find documents or other sites of interest.</p>
<p>This summer, Intuit and Excite will introduce a financial site with news, stock quotes and financial directories, the companies said. They expect to make money from advertising on the site and fees for a cut of financial services sold.</p>
