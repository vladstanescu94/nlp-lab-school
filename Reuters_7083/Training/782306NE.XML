<title>USA: Microsoft to invest in Apple, which revamps board.</title>
<headline>Microsoft to invest in Apple, which revamps board.</headline>
<dateline>BOSTON 1997-08-06</dateline>

<p>Apple Computer Inc. said on Wednesday that Microsoft Corp. agreed to invest $150 million in Apple stock and develop more programs for its Macintosh computers in a crucial sign of support for the struggling computer maker.</p>
<p>The Cupertino, Calif.-based company also revamped its board of directors, which had been seen as an obstacle to major change at the company that helped popularize the personal computer. Joining Apple's board are co-founder and strategic adviser Steve Jobs; Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison; former International Business Machines Corp. chief financial officer Jerome York and Intuit Inc. Chief Executive Bill Campbell.</p>
<p>Three current board members -- including early Apple investor and one-time chairman A.C. Mike Markkula, Katherine Hudson, and Bernard Goldstein -- resigned.</p>
<p>Investors said the changes could be the best moves Apple has made in the last three years to halt its steep slide. They reacted to the surprise announcement by sending Apple stock sharply higher. It surged $7.25 to $27 on Nasdaq and was among the most active stocks in U.S. markets.</p>
<p>Getting help from Microsoft -- the company that did the most to destroy Apple's lead in easy-to-use computers -- will not endear die-hard Macintosh fans. But it could goad the rest of the computer industry, particulary software companies and corporate computer buyers, to continue to support Apple.</p>
<p>&quot;That should ensure Apple being around for a while,&quot; said Arnie Owen, managing director at investment bank Cruttenden Roth. Microsoft &quot;is the biggest guy you could get to support you. That doesn't say that Apple is a great company, but there are parts of it that are worthwhile.&quot;</p>
<p>At the Macworld trade show in Boston, Microsoft said it would invest $150 million in non-voting Apple stock. The world's biggest software company also said it will develop a new version of its Office package of business software -- widely used at corporations.</p>
<p>Apple will bundle the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser with the Mac Operating System, making it the default browser in future operating system software releases.</p>
<p>Jobs said Microsoft will buy the stock at market prices over the next three years. Microsoft's stake is a non-voting interest in Apple and Microsoft has agreed not to sell its shares for at least three years.</p>
<p>Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates appeared at the conference in a satellite speech to a mixture of boos and applause from the audience. He called the investment in Apple &quot;very exciting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We think Apple makes a huge contribution in the computer industry,&quot; Gates said. &quot;And we think it's going to be a lot of fun helping out.&quot;</p>
<p>Jobs chided the Macworld audience, saying that they must let go of their previous notions. &quot;We want to let go of this notion that for Apple to win, Microsoft has to lose,&quot; he said. &quot;We need all the help we can get. We better treat Microsoft with a little gratitude.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said the investment was a shrewd move by Gates to deflect criticism that Microsoft was stifling competition in the computer industry. Federal antitrust regulators have been investigating Microsoft since 1989.</p>
<p>A healthy competitor such as Apple in the personal computer business would make it tougher to prove Microsoft has a monopoly in the software business, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are getting tremendous industry expertise,&quot; Jobs said in his keynote speech at Macworld.</p>
<p>Jobs was ousted as Apple chairman in 1985 but rejoined in December when Apple bought his Next Software Inc. He said the company will not name a chairman for now, leaving the possibility that he himself could head Apple once again.</p>
