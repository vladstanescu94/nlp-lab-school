<p>Summit Medical Systems Inc said its first-quarter loss of $4.5 million on revenues of $4.0 million included about $2.0 million in reserves primarily covering accounting and legal fees.</p>
<p>The fees &quot;have been or are expected to be incurred in connection with the company's recent restatement of revenues, various shareholder lawsuits and the investigation of the company by the (U.S.) Securities and Exchange Commission,&quot; said the healthcare information management systems company.  </p>
<p>The company said the reserves also cover expected settlement costs on renegotiating obligations under development and support contracts in various medical specialty markets that are not central to its near-term strategic focus, and severance costs associated with a downsizing in March.</p>
<p>The company also said it expects to continue to incur operating losses during 1997.</p>
<p>Summit said it has been named as a defendant in 10 civil actions involving alleged violations of federal securities and other laws. Summit said it believes that nine of the potential class actions will be consolidated into one action with a lead plaintiff and counsel.</p>
<p>Summit said it believes it has meritorious defenses to these actions and intends to defend against them vigorously.</p>
<p>Also, certain people who received common stock or other equity-based securities of the company, in connection with acquisitions during 1995 and 1996, are seeking compensation from the company. The company is currently discussing this matter with each of these parties, Summit said.</p>
<p>Summit also said interim chief financial officer Richard Willemin has become vice president, finance, and chief financial officer. Summit shares rose 1/4 to three Thursday.</p>
