<p>Microsoft Corp. said Friday that customers of its online Microsoft Network will be charged for several months' worth of accumulated service due to a billing problem that has been resolved.</p>
<p>In a letter sent to the service's 1.6 million members, Microsoft Vice President Laura Jennings said that over the next four to eight weeks customers will open their credit card and discover charges dating back several months.</p>
<p>&quot;We realise that it's not very pleasant to be faced with charges incurred some months ago, and we apologise for any inconvenience these delays may have caused,&quot; Jennings said in the letter.</p>
<p>A Microsoft source who asked not to be identified said the billing backlog, which dates to June, stemmed from a series of problems tied to the rapid growth of the service.</p>
<p>&quot;The billing system didn't scale well with the increase in membership,&quot; the source said. &quot;There wasn't one single problem -- it was architecture, it was infrastruture.&quot;</p>
<p>The source said the vast majority of accumulated bills will be less than $50 per member.</p>
<p>The credit card statements with the accumulated bills will include a prominently displayed toll-free telephone number, and representatives will work with customers individually to resolve problems.</p>
