<p>Marcam Corp., said Wednesday it plans to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies, MAPICS Inc. and Marcam Solutions Inc.</p>
<p>The company made the announcement as it released second quarter earnings. The company said it lost $5.3 million, or 46 cents a share, on sales of $43.8 million in the period ended March 31. A year earlier, the company lost $8.4 million, or 73 cents a share, on sales of $47.4 million.</p>
<p>Marcam said it has already filed a registration statement for a $75 million public offering of MAPICS common stock as part of the split-up. Marcam said it expects the separation to be completed by July.  </p>
<p>Under the new structure, Marcam Solutions will focus on delivering enterprise solutions to process manufacturers, while MAPICS, to be headquartered in Atlanta, will provide the same type of solutions primarily for discrete manufacturers.</p>
<p>Discrete manufacturers assemble things, like computers and automobiles while process manufacturers put together liquids, powdered or gaseous things like drugs, chemicals and foods, according a company spokesman.</p>
<p>Marcam said the the newly-formed Marcam Solutions will be spun off to stockholders in a tax-free distribution and include Marcam Corp's PRISM, Protean and Avantis software lines, plus $42 million cash.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the $75 million public offering of MAPICS will be used to fund a portion of the company's cash contribution to Marcam Solutions and for general corporate purposes, including working capital. The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.</p>
