<p>U.S. households with direct access to the Internet via an Internet Service Provider (ISP) outnumber homes where computer users reach the Internet via a commercial online service, according to a new study.</p>
<p>Market research firm Odyssey said its latest Homefront survey, released Monday, found that 48 percent of households surfing the Internet from home are using an ISP, while 35 percent use a commercial online service for Internet access. The research firm said the findings represent a sharp turnaround from six months ago, when it found 54 percent of at-home Internet surfers used commercial online services.  </p>
<p>Six months ago, only about 30 percent of home computer users gained access to the Internet via Internet Service Providers according to Odyssey.</p>
<p>In its latest study, the survey found that 14 percent of U.S. households are now on-line.</p>
<p>The study showed America Online's market share rose to 18 percent of the home PC market, up from 14 percent in January.</p>
<p>CompuServe Corp held 5 percent of the home PC market, down a point from January. CompuServe's recently introduced WOW! family-oriented service accounted for another one percent of the market.  </p>
<p>International Wireless's Prodigy users accounted for four percent, down from five percent.</p>
<p>The market for direct Internet access remains extremely fragmented, the market researchers said.</p>
<p>Even the most popular home consumer Internet service provider, Netcom On-Line Communications Inc, has only captured 8 percent of the ISP market, Odyssey said.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T Corp's WorldNet, the second most popular direct Internet access service, has attracted seven percent, while MCI Communications Corp and Performance Systems International Inc have 4 percent each.  </p>
<p>The rest of the market is divided among a myriad of smaller players.</p>
<p>On the browser front, Odyssey's Homefront survey indicated that Netscape Communications Corp still leads in the battle for at-home surfers versus Microsoft Corp.</p>
<p>The Netscape Navigator is more popular than Microsoft's Internet Explorer, with 54 percent of households surfing the Internet using the Netscape version, compared to 6 percent using the Microsoft browser.  </p>
<p>The survey found that the Internet is changing the way consumers evaluate a commercial online service and that the importance of proprietary content is &quot;clearly decreasing.&quot;</p>
<p>When asked to choose between quality of access to the Internet and quality of proprietary content, 41 percent chose quality of access to the Internet while only 29 percent deemed quality of the online service's proprietary content more important, the researchers said.</p>
<p>Six months ago 37 percent chose content over Internet access.</p>
<p>Odyssey President Nick Donatiello said online service providers have not risen to the challenge posed by ISPs.</p>
<p>&quot;Commercial online services have to convince consumers that they are better on some dimension that's important, if not proprietary content, then ease-of-use, or content packaging, or customization, or something,&quot; Donatiello said.</p>
<p>&quot;Pathetically slow Internet gateways and pricing schemes that seem to ignore the fact that they are now competing directly with ISPs just make it harder,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Odyssey's Homefront study is the largest in-depth national survey tracking the home computing market. Research is based on interviews with 2,000 consumers.</p>
