<title>USA: Microsoft's ActiveX has security flaw, Sun says.</title>
<headline>Microsoft's ActiveX has security flaw, Sun says.</headline>
<dateline>SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. 1997-04-03</dateline>

<p>Sun Microsystems Inc on Thursday demonstrated what it said was a security loophole in Microsoft Corp's ActiveX technology, which it said could enable a malicious hacker to break into a computer user's private financial files.</p>
<p>Sun showed how when a specially written program containing ActiveX was downloaded by a remote user, the program then took over the user's computer and rifled its files for personal financial information.</p>
<p>The demonstration brought to light the danger of downloading software over the Internet, Sun said, saying its own Java software, a rival to ActiveX, was much more secure for users.</p>
<p>The demonstration was made during a keynote speech by Sun CEO Scott McNealy at the company's JavaOne conference.</p>
<p>&quot;This raises the bar of security,&quot; Miko Matsumura, Sun's official &quot;evangelist&quot; for Java, said during the demonstration.</p>
<p>ActiveX is a powerful system of controls developed by Microsoft, which among other capabilities can make legitimate changes in a user's computer when the user downloads software from a Web site. The technology is a rival to Sun's Java initiative.</p>
<p>Sun executives said they see security as a major issue differentiating Java, which has been designed to enable programs to run in a protective &quot;sandbox,&quot; and ActiveX, for which security has recently become a looming issue.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a factor of 100 better security,&quot; Eric Schmidt, the Sun chief technology officer who is due to become chief executive of Novell Inc. next week, said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>&quot;The only way we know of to provide this level of security is to run the program in its own little sandbox, which is what Java does,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The program used in the demonstration was written by Fred Mclain, who said he did it to show the dangers of the powerful ActiveX software.</p>
<p>The ability to use ActiveX to infiltrate a computer in this way has been known for some time, but analysts said the Sun demonstration brought to light the danger of downloading software over the Internet.</p>
<p>Mclain, who develops programs for both ActiveX and for Java, said he would write similar programs on Java if future versions contain such security flaws.</p>
<p>&quot;If you can do the same thing in Java, I'll do it,&quot; he said, adding it took him just a couple of days to write the intrusive ActiveX programs, but he estimates fixing the problem would take more than two man-years of work.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an architectural security problem,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Cornelius Willis, Microsoft's director of marketing for Internet platforms, said Microsoft has built in a certification -- similar to one to be adapted by Java -- to ensure Web users can track a software maker's origins.</p>
<p>Mclain's demonstration used a certificate, which he later said had been revoked. Willis said Microsoft is building in a feature to check for revoked certificates.</p>
