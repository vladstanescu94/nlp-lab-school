<p>Dow Jones &amp; Co Inc and Microsoft Corp Tuesday said they planned to jointly develop new information and transactions systems for financial institutions worldwide.</p>
<p>The publisher of the Wall Street Journal and the software giant said they are looking forward to demonstrating to their mutual customers the benefits of open platforms on end-to-end financial systems.  </p>
<p>Earlier this year, Dow Jones announced a multiyear investment program that will enable its Dow Jones Markets unit to expand its content and services, and to upgrade its delivery systems and presentation technologies based on open Internet standards. With Microsoft technology and products, Dow Jones said it expects to be able to begin rolling out new capabilities later this year.</p>
<p>Dow Jones' systems will benefit from a variety of Microsoft Back Office family and desktop products, including the Windows NT Server network operating system, Microsoft SQL Server and Active X technologies. Microsoft Consulting Services will assist Dow Jones in designing its desktop environment.</p>
<p>&quot;Dow Jones understands the potential of the communications revolution to offer new products and services to its customers, and is leading the way as the financial services industry reinvents itself,&quot; said Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief executive.</p>
<p>Kenneth Burenga, president of Dow Jones and CEO of Dow Jones Markets,said, &quot;By working closely with Microsoft, we will be staying ahead of the technology curve. With Microsoft's assistance, Dow Jones intends to put our financial services customers at the center of their trading markets.&quot;</p>
