<p>Technology stocks rallied on Tuesday, with gains scored broadly across many sectors, amid what some traders called a recovery from recent doldrums.</p>
<p>Personal computer and semiconductor-related stocks seemed to drive the market, led by Intel Corp. which rose 3-11/32 to 97-29/32, Microsoft Corp., up 4-15/16 to 138-13/16, and Texas Instruments Inc. which jumped 9-1/8 to 128-1/8.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's Semiconductor Index .SOXX jumped 13.37 points, or 3.5 percent, to 394.57, while the Nasdaq Composite raced to 1,600.71, up 31.19.</p>
<p>Market watchers said no clear indicator or event spurred the gains, but they linked the rise to shortcovering, portfolio diversification and perceptions that tech stocks are set the lead the entire market through the rest of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's just a refocusing,&quot; Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray &amp; Co, said of the rally. &quot;People want to be more diversified and they seem to think the most bang for the buck is in tech stocks and small cap stocks.&quot;</p>
<p>One PC analyst noted that the even the shares of companies that had taken a hit recently on otherwise bearish news, like Apple Computer Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co., were infected by the market's strength. Apple climbed 13/16 to 24-7/16 and HP gained 10/16 to 64-7/16.</p>
<p>And traders of Gateway 2000 Inc. cited the end of the United Parcel Service strike for Gateway's rise to 40-3/8, up 2-15/16. UPS is one of Gateway's main shippers.</p>
<p>With summer -- the tech sectors weakest period -- nearly over and the peak holiday season on the horizon, traders said the market may resume a bullish track, led by chip makers like Intel and PC makers like Dell Computer Corp..</p>
<p>&quot;Now, coming out of the weakest month of the year and looking towards Christmas, people are looking at the trend of business, and saying 'I'd better look again at the right semiconductor companies,'&quot; Michael Gumpost of Lehman Brothers explained.</p>
<p>Coolidge suggested Tuesday's rally signals the start of a trend that may only be slowed by a course change in the nation's economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The breadth and depth of the rally is pretty strong,&quot; he said. &quot;I wouldn't expect this to fade unless there were some economic numbers that spook the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Other active chip makers included Applied Materials Inc. which gained 3-3/4 to 103-3/8, and Cyrix Corp. which rose 1-3/8 to 28-1/8.</p>
<p>Software firms gained, with Oracle Corp., up 2-5/8 to 41-1/8 and game maker Electronic Arts Inc., up 1-1/2 to 33-1/4.</p>
