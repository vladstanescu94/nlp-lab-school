<title>USA: US OPTIONS FOCUS/Big buyer of Oracle, Cisco calls.</title>
<headline>US OPTIONS FOCUS/Big buyer of Oracle, Cisco calls.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>One investor was a big buyer of two Oracle Corp and two Cisco Systems Inc call options Thursday, but traders said the strategy was unclear.</p>
<p>The Oracle May 40 call traded 6,120 contracts by about 1115 CDT/1615 GMT and the May 45 call traded about 5,100.</p>
<p>The Cisco May 50 call traded 3,200 and the May 55 traded about 4,225.</p>
<p>&quot;We think it's the type of customer that could come in in the next day or two and just bang it right back out,&quot; Patrick Hamilton of LETCO said.  </p>
<p>&quot;One can only begin to speculate what's going on,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Oracle shares were up 1-7/8 at 39-5/8 on turnover of about 4.5 million shares and Cisco rose 7/8 to 49-1/2 on 8.3 million shares.</p>
<p>Hamilton said Cisco has quarterly earnings scheduled for release in May, which could be one reason for the big call buys, but Oracle reports in June.</p>
<p>He added that volatility in the Cisco May calls had declined earlier this week to the mid-50 range.  </p>
<p>&quot;Starting Monday we had a lot of sellers in May,&quot; he said. Volatility &quot;is at a level where it can trade. I do anticipate it going up.&quot;</p>
<p>Trading remained fairly busy in International Business Machines Corp options as the stock surged after the computer giant reported strong quarterly earnings late Wednesday.</p>
<p>Some of the heaviest activity was in the high-volatility May 135, 140 and 145 puts, said Jon Najarian, president of Mercury Trading. Volatility in those options was in the mid- to upper-30s.  </p>
<p>Traders said investors were mainly selling the puts, which fell sharply as the stock rallied.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly there are a lot of people that had insurance that are now just ditching it, figuring they don't need it anymore,&quot; Najarian said. &quot;Those are the high volatility options right now.&quot;</p>
<p>The IBM May 140 put traded about 5,200 contracts, the May 150 traded 3,100 and the May 145 put traded 2,850.</p>
<p>On the call side, the May 155 traded nearly 6,900 contracts and the May 150 call traded about 4,725.</p>
<p>IBM shares were up 10-5/8 at 153.  </p>
<p>&quot;There were a lot of doubting Thomases,&quot; Najarian said of investors who doubted IBM's earnings would be strong enough to boost the stock, which had recovered from 127-1/8 in early April.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, what happened was blowout earnings,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In other trading, a sizable spread traded in options on Amoco Corp options.</p>
<p>The Amoco May 70 call traded 9,510 contracts and the November 75 call traded 4,405.</p>
<p>Amoco shares were down 5/8 at 82-7/8.</p>
