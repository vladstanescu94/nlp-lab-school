<p>Apple Computer Inc is broadening its strategy in Asia to increase business, a company senior official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Steve Vamos, vice president and managing director of Apple Asia Pacific, said the company had refocused its investment &quot;away from just pure manufacturing into a full business model&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;You'll see us leveraging the skills and the infrastructure in Singapore much more broadly and much more integrating ourselves in marketing efforts than we have to date,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Vamos, in Singapore for a MacWorld Exposition opening on Friday, said Apple would focus on everything it would take to get a product from the factory to the customer.</p>
<p>This includes new processes like build-to-order, working more closely with distributors and assemblers to meet the needs of different customers and regions and to reduce cost.</p>
<p>Apple would look to adding new skills to its plant in Singapore, its only one in Asia, he said.</p>
<p>In the last three months, Apple's Singapore plant has laid off some 350 workers and closed its design centre and printed circuit board operations.</p>
<p>But Vamos said he did not see Apple selling direct to customers like Dell.</p>
<p>Vamos said revenues in Asia grew 12 percent in its fiscal third quarter ended June 1997 compared to the second. He did not reveal how much revenues were in those periods.</p>
<p>He said Apple's Asian business was focused on publishing, and that revenues in China in its third fiscal quarter quarter rose 40 percent over the previous year.</p>
<p>Apple said earlier this week it expected another loss in its fourth quarter ending in September and that sales for the period would be lower than a year ago.</p>
<p>Apple's market share in Asia was around two percent just by concentrating on publishing and education sectors, Vamos said.</p>
<p>&quot;If we can gain share position to around three or four percent, our business will grow significantly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said he would like Apple to focus on the school and learning markets in the Asian region to gain market share.</p>
<p>Vamos said the tie-up with Microsoft Corp would help the company address the corporate market.</p>
<p>Under the recently announced deal, Microsoft is investing US$150 million in Apple and has promised to develop major product upgrades for Apple's MacIntosh Operating System for a period of five years, including its Office software for the Mac 1998 version.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Internet Explorer will also become Apple's default Web browser but does not exclude use of Netscape Communications Corp's products.</p>
<p>&quot;We use the partnership with Microsoft to shore up the base of users of office automation predominantly,&quot; Vamos said.</p>
<p>Apple would use its own investments and skills in creativity to differentiate itself in the home, government, education and business segments.</p>
<p>On Rhapsody, its new operating system scheduled for developer release by end 1997, Vamos said it would support Mac OS applications and there were more applications than the market knew about.</p>
<p>But it was too early to expect big players like Microsoft to ship software for Rhapsody, he said.</p>
