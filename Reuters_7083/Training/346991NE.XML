<text>
<p>A federal judge sentenced Friday Charles Huttoe, former chairman and chief excecutive officer of Systems of Excellence Inc, for his alleged role in massive market manipulation involving shares of the company.</p>
<p>James Catheris, U.S. District Court judge for the Eastern District of Virigina, sentenced Huttoe to 46 months in a federal prison followed by two years' supervised release and a $10,000 fine.  </p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission had charged that Huttoe manipulated the market by issuing false, favorable information concerning the company using a stock promoter, and then selling his shares after the price had artifically risen.</p>
<p>Huttoe pled guilty on November 13, 1996 as part of an agreement with the government.  The plea agreement had been filed under seal.</p>
<p>Also kept under seal was criminal information alleging that, in connection with the securites fraud count, from March 1995 through September 1996, Huttoe distributed about 11 million shares of unregistered company stock to certain nominees including three relatives, under his control, the Securites and Exchange said in a litigation release.</p>
<p>In connection with the money laundering count, it was further alleged Huttoe subsequently transferred about $7.55 million of the trading profits from brokerage accounts.</p>
<p>The brokers' accounts were opened in the names of the nominees. Huttoe, then transferred about $7.3 million from these accounts to an account at Patriot National Bank in Virginia, the document alleged.</p>
<p>Huttoe tranferred about $7.2 million out of this account by wire or check to various individuals or entities, it alleged.</p>
