<p>U.S. networking products group Novell Inc plans to maintain its research and development spending at about 17 percent of revenues as it focuses aggressively on its Internet and intranets businesses, a top official said here on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The important thing is that during the past year, that percentage of revenues also got spent on things like WordPerfect,&quot; said Vic Langford, senior vice president of Novell's Internet and Intranet services unit, referring to the disposal of that company early this year.  </p>
<p>&quot;What we now have is the same percentage totally focused on the Internet and intranets,&quot; he said in an interview.</p>
<p>Langford, based in San Jose, California, was in London for a technology conference where Novell was set to unveil NetWare for SAA with International Business Machines Corp.</p>
<p>The product enables customers to connect servers to IBM mainframes, he said.</p>
<p>Langford said analysts expect the U.S. company to report revenues of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion this year, although he would not comment on the company's own forecasts.  </p>
<p>He reiterated Novell's plans to use aggressive marketing for its NetWare and IntraNetware software to counter competition from Microsoft Corp's rival product, Windows NT.</p>
<p>The group expected to maintain its 63 percent share of the global network operating system market, despite Microsoft's competition, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're putting more dollars into marketing and getting our message out than ever before,&quot; he said, noting that Novell currently spends over $20 million on advertising and promotion expenses per quarter.  </p>
<p>He also said Novell planned to concentrate on its existing businesses and did not expect further disposals.</p>
<p>Novell sold WordPerfect earlier this year to Corel Corp for stock worth about $130 million after buying the company in 1994 for $1.4 billion of stock.</p>
<p>When asked about acquisitions, he said, &quot;There might be some, but certainly not of the order of the WordPerfect acquisition or anything like that.&quot;</p>
<p>However, the company did plan to use some of its $1.0 billion in cash to strengthen its partnerships, he said.</p>
<p>The company also expected to announce this week a pact under which Microsoft will license some of Novell's linguistic technology for integration in their desktop applications.</p>
