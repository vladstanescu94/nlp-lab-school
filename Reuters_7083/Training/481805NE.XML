<title>USA: PeopleSoft falls on earnings fears - analysts.</title>
<headline>PeopleSoft falls on earnings fears - analysts.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares of PeopleSoft Inc dropped sharply amid investor concerns about earnings, but the worries may prove unfounded, analysts said.</p>
<p>PeopleSoft, which produces human resource management and financial system software, was off five points to 34-3/4 in heavy trading.</p>
<p>Investors dumped shares of PeopleSoft following an earnings warning by Informix Corp late Tuesday.</p>
<p>But analysts said Informix's woes are not a good barometer of how PeopleSoft will fare this quarter.  </p>
<p>Although PeopleSoft's applications run on Informix's database software products, Informix represents a small portion of PeopleSoft's revenues, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is little correlation between PeopleSoft and Informix. The majority of PeopleSoft's application are run on other companies' products,&quot; said Andrew Roskill, an analyst with Smith Barney.</p>
<p>Roskill said rumors circulated throughout the market Wednesday that he had downgraded PeopleSoft. Roskill said this was not true, and he reiterated his outperform rating on the stock to quell the rumors.  </p>
<p>Roskill said PeopleSoft appears to be on track for the March quarter. He expects the company to earn $0.12 a share on revenues of $150 million.</p>
<p>Other analysts agree that PeopleSoft's business fundamentals remain strong.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no problem with PeopleSoft. I don't think anybody should be concerned about the quarter,&quot; said Bert Hochfeld, an analyst with Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross. &quot;I would be very, very surprised if they had a miss this quarter.&quot;</p>
<p>Neil Herman, an analyst with Salomon Brothers, said of the stock's price decline, &quot;It's probably fear, doubt, uncertainty about technology companies and the quarter. But there's nothing in particular going on with PeopleSoft to cause that (stock movement).&quot;</p>
<p>Herman said that as investors become increasingly skittish about technology companies, stocks such as PeopleSoft with high price/earnings multiples have been the hardest hit.</p>
<p>&quot;We're at the point of maximum stress about the quarter. Informix's pre-announcement now has people generally more concerned,&quot; said James Mendelson, an analyst with SoundView Financial Group.</p>
<p>PeopleSoft officials cound not be reached for comment.</p>
