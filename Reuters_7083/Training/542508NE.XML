<headline>Geoworks CEO agrees with breakeven in '98.</headline>
<dateline>SAN FRANCISCO 1997-04-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>GeoWorks Inc chief executive Gordon Mayer said Wall Street's view that his company will hit a break even point in early 1998 is &quot;very reasonable.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts have said they expect Geoworks to break even in either the March 1998 quarter or June 1998 quarter.</p>
<p>Geoworks makes operating system software for smart phones -- next generation digital wireless phone -- computer devices that are just now starting to appear on the market.  </p>
<p>Mayer said Geoworks' royalty revenue from telephone handset makers is about to take off because of product launches.</p>
<p>Geoworks' operating system is used in Nokia Oy's new Nokia 9000 smart phone which Nokia recently began shipping. Mayer said Toshiba Corp, NEC Corp and Ericsson expected to launch Geoworks-based smart phones this year.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Hambrecht &amp; Quist Technology Conference, Mayer said that Geoworks also is seeking out partners from cellular operating companies which will provide an additional revenue stream.</p>
<p>To date, Geoworks has had scant revenues and no earnings as it developed its operating system and worked to market it among handset manufacturers.</p>
<p>But smart-phone technology, products and infrastructure are now market ready. Nokia's phone, which works on the GSM digital wireless architecture deployed through Europe and much of Asia, is being shipped into 30 countries.</p>
