<title>USA: Avant! stock tumbles on charges of technology theft.</title>
<headline>Avant! stock tumbles on charges of technology theft.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>The stock of Avant! Corp. lost almost 47 percent of its value on Tuesday, a day after the Santa Clara County, Calif., district attorney's office said it filed felony charges against the company for allegedly stealing Cadence Design Systems Inc. technology.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform, adding fuel to the sell-off.</p>
<p>The stock fell $11.44 to $13.06 on Nasdaq, where it was among the most active stocks in afternoon trading.</p>
<p>On Monday, the district attorney alleged that Avant, its president and other senior officials misappropriated Cadence's Symbad, Froute, Groute, Qplace and Vsize technologies, and &quot;then used that stolen technology to develop and market competing products.&quot;</p>
<p>Avant denied the district attorney's allegations in a statement issued late on Monday.</p>
<p>Avant and Cadence have been bitter rivals for years. They both sell software that helps engineers design the intricate layouts of computer chips.</p>
<p>For more than a year, Cadence has been pressing its own civil action against Avant, alleging its rival stole some of its programming codes and used them in its own products.</p>
<p>All of the officials charged were former employees of Cadence Design Systems, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Santa Clara County prosecutors said they have filed felony charges of conspiracy and theft of trade secrets against Avant, its president and director Gerald Hsu, vice president of engineering Tzyh-Lih Wuu, vice president of technology Yuh-Zen Liao, and director Yun-Chung Eric Cho.</p>
<p>Charges were also filed against Avant employee Chih-Liang Eric Cheng; director of business operations Shiaoli Leigh Huang; and Mitsuru Igusa, according to prosecutors.</p>
