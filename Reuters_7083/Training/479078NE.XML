<headline>Informix stock plunges on loss forecast, dim outlook.</headline>

<p>Informix Corp. shares plunged to a three-year low Tuesday after the database software company said it expected to report a &quot;substantial&quot; first-quarter loss on far weaker-than-expected sales.</p>
<p>Informix said it expected to report revenue of $130 million to $145 million, about 30 percent less than the $204 million reported in the same quarter a year ago and far less than Wall Street expected.</p>
<p>Shares of Informix, based in Menlo Park, Calif., fell $5.125 to $10 in mid-afternoon trading of 22 million shares, making the stock the second-most active on the Nasdaq. Earlier, the shares traded as low as $8.75.</p>
<p>The company blamed weak sales on an &quot;over-emphasis&quot; of marketing on a new, jazzy version of its flagship database software product, at the expense of neglecting its proven line of existing products.</p>
<p>&quot;We were literally enamoured with our technology lead and we took our eyes off the core business,&quot; said Phil White, Informix chief executive, in a conference call with investors.</p>
<p>Informix writes computer programmes, called databases, that let big companies store and retrieve huge amounts of vital information, such as customer names and inventory lists.</p>
<p>In December, Informix introduced Universal Server, a database that can not only store text and numbers like a traditional database, but also video, sound, photographs, maps and other non-traditional types of data.</p>
<p>Informix executives last year bet that there would be huge demand for a database that could store media, as companies rushed to set up elaborate sites on the World Wide Web. They also expected existing customers to upgrade quickly to the new database.</p>
<p>Things will take much longer than Informix planned, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Universal Server is cool technology, but people don't go out to buy technology,&quot; said David Rothschild, managing director of brokerage Piper Jaffrey in Minneapolis. They buy proven products to help them manage vital records, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a classic product transition,&quot; said Charles Phillips, software analyst at investment bank Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York. &quot;They're trying to sell a new product before it's ready to be sold and they're not concentrating on the old product.&quot;</p>
<p>Also, Informix seems to be losing ground to Oracle Corp., the biggest vendor of database software.</p>
<p>Oracle, too, is pitching a new generation of database software. Some customers may be waiting to check out Oracle's updated database product -- dubbed Oracle8 and scheduled to be released in June -- before buying from Informix, analysts said.</p>
