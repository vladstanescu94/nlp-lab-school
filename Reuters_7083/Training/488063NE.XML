<text>
<p>Summit Medical Systems Inc, which said last month it expected to revise downward results for three years, on Friday reported a revised net loss for 1996 of $12,836,000, compared with the previously reported loss for the year of $10,368,000.</p>
<p>Revenues for the year were revised downward to $17,172,000, compared with $19,543,000 previously. The 1996 net loss includes a $4,746,000 charge associated with the buyout of Cordillera LLC, a joint venture with Duke University, and expenses related to the acquisition of C.L. McIntosh &amp; Associates.  </p>
<p>For 1995, Summit Medical, restated downward its net loss to $9,024,000 from a loss of $7,163,000 previously, and revised revenues to $15.5 million from $17.7 million previously. For 1994, the net loss was restated to $1,173,000 from a previously reported net loss of $300,000, and revenues were revised to $11.3 million from $12.3 million.</p>
<p>Cumulative revenues for the three-year-period were $5,638,000 less than originally reported, a 11 percent reduction. Amounts for 1995 and 1994 included the results of acquisitions that were accounted for on a pooling-of-interests basis, Summit said.  </p>
<p>Summit, which provides management systems and information services for the healthcare industry, said it retained the law firm of Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP to represent the company in three class-action shareholder law suit.</p>
<p>The law firm also will represent it in an investigation by the Security and Exchange Commission, which Summit said it is cooperating with fully.</p>
<p>&quot;With respect to 1996 operating results and performance, we simply did not meet our expectations,&quot;  Kevin Green, president and chief executive, said in a statement.</p>
