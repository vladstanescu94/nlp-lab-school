<p>German telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom AG said on Tuesday it expects profits to double this year and that it would expand cooperation between its T-Online service and Microsoft Corp</p>
<p>Chairman Ron Sommer said that net profit at its parent company rose 23 percent in 1996 to 1.6 billion marks ($938 million), assuring payment of a 60 pfennig dividend. &quot;Group net profit will, of course, be higher than this,&quot; he told a news conference before the CeBIT information technology trade fair in Hanover.</p>
<p>As earlier reported, Telekom sales rose some six percent to 63.1 billion marks last year and parent operating earnings rose to six billion marks from four billion the year before.</p>
<p>Sommer declined to give details about 1996 group results before the company's planned annual news conference in May, but said the first months of 1997 showed that the company was on track to meet its forecasts and pay a dividend of 1.20 marks.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect the positive sales trend to continue in the current year,&quot; he said. &quot;By indicating that the dividend is going to double we can already be assured that net profit will more than double.&quot;</p>
<p>The company's shares surged on Sommer's statements, closing at an all-time high of 34.85 marks, up 93 pfennigs, in bourse trade and continuing to rise in computerised IBIS trade to over 35 marks by mid-afternoon.</p>
<p>Sommer said he was satisfied with the company's share price since its stock offering in November and dismissed criticism that the shares had traded in a narrow range compared with its 28.50 mark offer price.</p>
<p>&quot;We are building the value of our shares for investors who think in a long-term time frame, not for speculators,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Telekom's share launch, the largest ever in Europe, attracted around two million private shareholders and gave a sorely-needed boost to Germany's weak &quot;share culture&quot;.</p>
<p>So far, those shareholders have stuck with Telekom through thick and thin in its short history as a listed company, but the next test of investor grit is just around the corner.</p>
<p>In Germany, investors who hold shares for less than six months must pay taxes on capital gains from share price appreciation, but if they hold them longer the gain is tax-free.</p>
<p>&quot;That is the next big test,&quot; said Sommer, adding that few of the private investors had taken profits at highs or bailed out when the shares briefly touched a low of 29 marks.</p>
<p>Sommer also announced that the 1.4 million subscribers to its online service T-Online would in future have access to the Microsoft Network (MSN), the online service of Microsoft Corp.</p>
<p>In an extension of a cooperation agreement between Telekom and the U.S. software group, MSN content -- online magazines and so-called chat forums -- will be integrated in T-Online.</p>
<p>The next version of T-Online software, available this week at CeBIT, will also include Microsoft's World Wide Web browser, Internet Explorer, to its subscribers. T-Online will continue to distribute the Web browser from Netscape Communications.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very happy about the promising partnership between Microsoft and Deutsche Telekom -- the leading online provider in Europe,&quot; said Microsoft chief Bill Gates in a written statement.</p>
<p>In a further indication of the rough and tumble competition facing Telekom as the market continues to open, Debitel, a joint venture of Daimler-Benz AG and retail group Metro Holding AG, said it planned to offer long distance services to businesses.</p>
<p>Debitel does not operate its own communications network. Instead, it leases capacity from mobile phone operators and resells it with additional services. As a so-called &quot;reseller&quot;, Debitel has become the third largest mobile communications company in Germany and one of the largest in Europe.</p>
<p>Debitel now plans to begin offering resale services for fixed-wire long-distance calls for business, the first mobile company to branch off into simple resale.</p>
<p>The new service is called DirectLine and works by re-routing long-distance phone calls to a switch operated by RSL Com, a former subsidiary of Sprint Corp in the United States, taking advantage of cheaper U.S. phone rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Large companies whose monthly charges for international calls are more than 10,000 marks can save as much as 40 percent,&quot; Debitel managing director Joachim Dreyer said.</p>
