<p>Informix Corp said it will downsize certain operations and reorganize its sales and marketing organization in a restructuring that will result in a second quarter charge against earnings.</p>
<p>The moves came as the company reported a first quarter loss and announced the resignation of its chief financial officer.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no question that this has been a painful wake-up call but we're confident that current initiatives will ultimately put us back on the right course,&quot; said chairman Phillip White in a news release.  </p>
<p>Informix did not identify areas to be downsized, saying only it will be &quot;certain operations that generate inadequate revenues.&quot;</p>
<p>Informix said the plan will result in considerable savings, improve customer focus and eliminate duplication.</p>
<p>Under the plan, Informix will be restructured into a single sales force for North America under Martin Brauns, vice president of North America sales.</p>
<p>Also, the company's consulting, training and advanced technology group will be brought back into the sales organization so that it can aid in the sale of products.</p>
<p>Informix said it will combine industry marketing and data warehouse business development under Steve Sommer, vice president for Enterprise Solutions. Sommer will be responsible for marketing core products, managing industry marketing and other activities.</p>
<p>Other actions include moving customer service and product marketing into the group headed by Mike Saranga, senior vice president, product management and development.</p>
