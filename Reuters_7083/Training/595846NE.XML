<p>Novell Inc will unveil Monday new networking software and discuss its strategy to embrace the Internet, as it also hopes to woo back Wall Street's interest in the tarnished software firm.</p>
<p>On Monday, its new CEO Eric Schmidt will also try to steal some of Microsoft Corp's thunder, a day ahead of its &quot;scalability day,&quot; where the software giant is expected to tout its Windows NT operating system as being able to support thousands of networked users and systems with many processors.  </p>
<p>&quot;The intent we have in doing this event on Monday is to highlight the progress we have made in building Internet products,&quot; said Chris Barney, a senior director of marketing for IntranetWare at Novell.</p>
<p>Novell, whose flagship product is a networking operating system called NetWare, has been criticized for missing the boat as many other companies realized the importance of the Internet. It is now revamping its propietary operating system and making it compatible with Internet technology.  </p>
<p>NetWare has evolved to IntranetWare, which now lets users of NetWare-based corporate networks can easily get onto the Internet, integrate Internet messaging, Web publishing and data files with a NetWare based network.</p>
<p>Monday, Novell will unveil software that is also expected to improve the security and performance of a corporate network. One product called BorderManager will help users protect their connections where the corporate network links to the Internet and it increases the security. It also protects certain parts of the network internally, such as payroll records, making them available to only authorized users or the finance department.  </p>
<p>Novell will also demonstrate its Novell Replication Services software, which will let servers all over a corporate network be updated with new information simultaneously, for better network management.</p>
<p>&quot;Eric Schmidt is making a very strong stand that Novell is not out of this game,&quot; said Waverly Deutsch, a Forrester Research analyst.</p>
<p>Schmidt will also be addressing Wall Street analysts at a separate meeting, where he hopes to reinvigorate their interest in the company, whose moribund stock currently trades around $8.  </p>
<p>Novell's prior CEO, Robert Frankenberg, was saddled with the task of selling off numerous businesses that diverted its attention from its core networking business, such as WordPerfect and Unix Systems Labs. During his regime, the company was frequently the target of takeover rumors.</p>
<p>Now Wall Street has a wait and see attitude, and some firms have stopped following the stock. According to First Call, 15 brokerage firms follow Novell, compared with 21 in 1995.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think it's just the perennial transition story,&quot; said Chris Galvin, a Hambrecht &amp; Quist analyst. &quot;It's going to take some time before Schmidt has an impact. I don't think it's going to be anytime soon.&quot;</p>
<p>Novell will also be showing analysts and customers future products such as its Wolf Mountain technology, which is also the subject of lawsuit that Novell has filed against three former engineers and their start-up company. Wolf Mountain uses clustering technology to enable dozens of computers linked together to act as one machine.  </p>
<p>&quot;Wall Street needs to see us executing on our plans,&quot; said Barney, adding that the company is hosting its event at New York's Guggenheim Museum because it is an example of a customer that is using IntranetWare to communicate with international sites and partners over the Internet.</p>
