<headline>PeopleSoft shrs fall, rival's revenue jumps.</headline>

<p>PeopleSoft Inc. shares fell as much as 9.6 percent Tuesday amid investor concern that a huge jump in software rival SAP AG's, revenue came at PeopleSoft's expense, analysts said.</p>
<p>Pleasanton, Calif.-based PeopleSoft, whose software helps big companies keep track of human resources and financial records, added to speculation it is feeling the heat from SAP when it said Tuesday it plans to ship the next big release of its key software products six months earlier than planned.</p>
<p>In late morning trading, PeopleSoft shares were down 1-3/8 at 32- 1/2. Earlier, the shares traded as low as 30-5/8.  </p>
<p>&quot;SAP reported a measly 91 percent revenue increase in the Americas,&quot; said Neil Herman, software analyst at investment bank Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York. Herman said he would not guess whether SAP's gain came at the expense of PeopleSoft, but said, judging by PeopleSoft's stock drop, some of his clients thought so.</p>
<p>SAP, Germany's biggest software company, competes with PeopleSoft in selling financial and human resources software. SAP said Tuesday its first-quarter revenue almost doubled to $615 million.  </p>
<p>PeopleSoft is expected to release its first-quarter earnings after the market close on Tuesday. Wall Street expects the company to earn $0.12 a share, according to a recent analyst survey by Zacks Investment Research. In the same quarter a year ago, PeopleSoft earned $9.6 million, or $0.17 per share.</p>
<p>Analysts said PeopleSoft should be able to meet forecasts. Jim Mendelson, analyst at SoundView Financial Group, said recent calls to customers indicated PeopleSoft did not indicate anything was wrong.</p>
<p>PeopleSoft said Tuesday it will release PeopleSoft 7, the new version of its package of management software, in September -- six months earlier than it had previously planned.</p>
<p>The new version will feature more setup flexibility and access to data through the Internet.</p>
<p>PeopleSoft executives said they were moving up the release date because the products have been tested thoroughly enough.</p>
<p>Analysts said the move could be contributing to concerns that PeopleSoft is working harder to keep customers from defecting to SAP.</p>
