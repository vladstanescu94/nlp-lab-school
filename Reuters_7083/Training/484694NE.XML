<title>USA: Apple shares rise on takeover speculation.</title>
<headline>Apple shares rise on takeover speculation.</headline>
<dateline>CUPERTINO, Calif. 1997-04-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Apple Computer Inc shares rose as much as 6.3 percent Thursday on renewed speculation that the troubled computer maker is trying to sell itself to a bigger company.</p>
<p>Shares of the Cupertino, Calif., company were up 7/8 at 18-7/8 in mid-afternoon trading of 4.26 million shares, making the stock the eighth-most active on the Nasdaq. Earlier, the shares traded as high as 19-1/8.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Saudi billionaire prince al-Waleed bin Talal revealed he bought a five percent stake in Apple for $115 million because he expects the company to turn itself around.  </p>
<p>Last week, software billionaire Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle Corp, said he intended to form an investor group to try to buy a majority stake in Apple, take control of the company and revamp it with a new management team.</p>
<p>The New York Times, citing unnamed Apple sources, also reported Thursday that Apple is actively seeking to sell itself and has approached Sun Microsystems Inc again. Sun tried to buy Apple in late 1995, but negotiations fell apart over price.  </p>
<p>An Apple spokeswomen declined to comment about the speculation.  Scott McNealy, Sun chief executive, also declined to comment about the rumors, &quot;no matter how accurate or silly they may be.&quot;</p>
<p>Mulling takeover bids is nothing new at Apple.  In addition to Sun, Apple has negotiated with International Business Machines Corp in recent years.  </p>
<p>A former high-level Apple executive who keeps close contact with the company said he has not heard of any recent moves by Apple to approach suitors, but increasing pressure from investors -- who hold stock near a 10-year low -- may make Chairman Gilbert Amelio more receptive to any takeover proposal that might come along.</p>
<p>Trouble is, none might come along, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's always possible, but we're not putting a lot of weight into it,&quot; said Peter Andrews, analyst at brokerage AG Edwards &amp; Sons Inc in St. Louis.  </p>
<p>Even though Apple still has a huge following of Macintosh users, the company will not be able to stop its sales from falling for at least another year, making it an unattractive buyout, analysts said.</p>
<p>In the past five quarters Apple has reported financial losses of close to $1 billion and has had two rounds of job cuts totalling 5,400.  Despite the massive expense reductions, the company does not expect to report a profit until the September quarter.</p>
<p>Company executives have told investors they expect revenue for the year to fall about 20 percent to $8 billion.</p>
