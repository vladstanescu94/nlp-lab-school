<p>TENERA Inc said it had redeployed the company's assets into three operating subsidiaries and that it was reviewing joint venture opportunities to develop its technology base.</p>
<p>The company said its government business would be consolidated withing TENERA Rocky Flats LLC, an existing Colorado limited liability. Its commercial electric power utility business would be consolidated within TENERA Engery LLC, a newly-formed Delaware limited liability company based in San Francisco, it said.  </p>
<p>Its mass transportation business would be consolidated within TENERA Technologies LLC, another newly-formed Delaware limited liability company based in San Francisco.</p>
<p>&quot;Although the nature of the company has evolved and significant improvements have been made, we are a small company, in multiple business areas, facing the challenge of applying our limited resources to fuel significant growth in each of these areas simultaneously,&quot; TENERA's Chairman Michael Thomas said.</p>
<p>The company said it set up the operating subsidiaries to reduce overhead business costs and maximize efficiencies of its business lines.</p>
<p>TENERA also said it named Robert McKay as chief operating officer. McKay has served as senior vice president since 1992.</p>
