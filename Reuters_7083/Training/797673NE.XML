<p>Apple Computer Inc shouldn't plan on using Europe as a springboard for a comeback in the personal computer business, a market researcher said on Wednesday after releasing second quarter shipment estimates.</p>
<p>Apple's European unit shipments in the second quarter fell 31 percent, compared the same period a year ago, and its market share ranking fell to ninth place from fifth, International Data Corp (IDC) told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The immediate outlook is pretty bleak,&quot; said IDC analyst Philip Williams in London. &quot;I don't think Europe is going to be a holdout for Apple.&quot;</p>
<p>In the past Europe had been something of a strongpoint for Apple, which has lost millions of dollars over the last few years and last week appointed a new board of directors. It was still looking for a CEO to replace Gilbert Amelio, who resigned last month after only 17 months on the job.</p>
<p>Previously Apple had benefited from European bias against Apple nemisis Microsoft Corp and chip maker Intel Corp, and was accepted almost as a local company in France, Williams said.</p>
<p>But even Gallic computer users have turned away from the company as it has gone through a series of chief executives and turnaround strategies. Apple's French sales in the second quarter were down 30 percent from last year, IDC said.</p>
<p>&quot;People in Europe are going to give Apple a chance as long as possible, but they won't go beyond a certain point,&quot; Williams said. &quot;They still look at the global situation and it isn't very good.&quot;</p>
<p>While Apple's European market share fell to 2.6 percent in the second quarter from 4.2 percent a year ago, its competitors in the Microsoft-Intel camp experienced robust growth.</p>
<p>According to IDC figures, which echo data previously released by other researchers, top-ranked Compaq increased its share to 14. 1 percent from 11.8 percent, as second quarter unit sales rose 30 percent.</p>
<p>IBM Corp. was second with 8.7 percent of the European market, down from 9.3 percent last year. Its unit sales rose only two percent while third and fourth ranked Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Computer Corp. notched large gains.</p>
<p>HP's second quarter unit sales rose 44.5 percent, boosting its market share to 6.9 percent from 5.2 percent. Dell's sales climbed 47 percent, lifting its share to 5.7 percent from 4.3 percent.</p>
<p>Siemens-Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG rounded out the top five with a 5.6 percent share, up from 4.0 percent in the second quarter of 1996. Its unit sales in the quarter rose 53.2 percent, IDC said.</p>
<p>Toshiba Corp., Germany's Vobis Microcomputer AG and the PC unit of Fujitsu Ltd were also ahead of Apple.</p>
<p>The European PC market as a whole, with unit sales up 9.1 percent, grew slower than the U.S. and Asian markets, where growth rates reached the high teens.</p>
