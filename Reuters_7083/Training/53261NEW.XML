<p>Database software giant Oracle Corp. said Thursday its earnings more than doubled in its fiscal first quarter, partially because of a big charge in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Earnings rose 110 percent to $113 million, or 17 cents a share, for its first fiscal quarter ended Aug. 31 from $54 million, or 8 cents a share, a year ago when it took a $34 million one-time charge.</p>
<p>The earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations.</p>
<p>Oracle's revenue growth, however, was slower than recent quarters as sales of software licenses slowed to 27 percent in a typical first quarter, summer slowdown, the company said.</p>
<p>Revenues rose 36 percent to $1.05 billion from $772 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The first quarter is always a little bit of a struggle for us to to get started again. We just don't get the sales effort as other quarters of the year,&quot; said Jeff Henley, Oracle's chief financial officer. In the previous quarter, license sales grew 45 percent.</p>
<p>Oracle's incentive based sales compensation programme leads sales people to do an all out push in the fourth quarter, he said, and take it easier in the first quarter.</p>
<p>But he said the license sales growth was more than a year ago when in the same quarter they grew 25 percent.</p>
<p>Oracle reported its results after the close of the stock market Thursday. In after-hours trading following the report, its shares fell 25 cents from their $37.50 a share close. The stock had risen 87.5 cents in regular trading hours.</p>
<p>Oracle said license sales growth was led by its core database products, whose revenues grew 41 percent.</p>
<p>Revenues from services such as consulting, training and support rose 45 percent in the quarter, Oracle said.</p>
<p>The Redwood Shores, Calif,-based company said sales from all geographic regions of the world were solid, but sales from customers in North and South America were the strongest, growing 43 percent.</p>
