<p>Executives of regional phone company U S West Communications Group told state lawmakers Thursday that price hikes are the only way to reduce telephone system congestion caused by increasing use of the Internet.</p>
<p>Lobbyists for computer industry giants, including Microsoft Corp as well as consumer groups, immediately charged that U S West has only itself to blame for service problems. They also disputed that Internet users are overloading the phone network.</p>
<p>In recent months, some U S West customers in Washington's larger cities such as Seattle and Spokane have encountered constant busy signals or heard a recorded message saying &quot;all circuits are busy&quot; when attempting local calls.</p>
<p>The company blames the problem in part on flat rate-unlimited service offers by Internet service providers such as America Online Inc.</p>
<p>U S West says customers, who pay a flat monthly rate for local telephone service, are leaving their computers online for hours at a time, tying up valuable phone lines.</p>
<p>U S West corporate counsel Edward Shaw told a Washington state Senate panel the company cannot build its way out of the problem.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't have that much money,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The answer therefore is price incentives, said Shaw, who outlined a sliding scale pricing scheme.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumers should have a flat rate for a reasonable amount of voice traffic, and that could be very generous,&quot;  he said, offering $10 for 20 hours of service per month as a possibility. &quot;But if you're going to hook your computer up and use more than that, you should pay an increment.&quot;</p>
<p>Computer industry representatives asserted that Internet usage cannot be blamed for crippling the public phone network.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't had a system that evolved enough to keep up with us,&quot; said American Electronics Association lobbyist Ian MacGowan.</p>
<p>He urged legislators to maintain pressure on the phone company to invest in its infrastructure.</p>
<p>Microsoft state government affairs director Deborah Brunton cited an industry-commissioned study that said the growth of the Internet has provided additional revenue to phone companies as customers purchase additional lines and enhanced services.</p>
<p>&quot;The additional revenues have exceeded the increased costs from the growth of these services by a factor of greater than five to one,&quot; Brunton testified.</p>
<p>A measure before the Washington Senate Energy and Utilities Committee would prohibit mandatory measured service such as U S West is proposing.</p>
<p>The committee chairman, Republican Sen. Bill Finkbeiner, said he believes the measure has the votes to pass.</p>
<p>U S West Communications provides local phone service across 14 Western states.</p>
