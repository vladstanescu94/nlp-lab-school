<p>Silicon Valley is not just unique to California. The tiny Republic of Ireland, with its population of 3.6 million, has attracted a list of major international names that reads like a Who's Who in the high technology arena.</p>
<p>&quot;In the last 10 years, Ireland has established itself as the software capital of Europe,&quot; said Kieran McGowan, chief executive of IDA Ireland, the state body whose task it is to attract overseas investment.</p>
<p>&quot;Since Lotus established here in 1984, a list of overseas software companies have followed their example, including five of the world's top 10 independent software houses,&quot; McGowan said.</p>
<p>Ireland now treats as household names international conglomerates such as Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Novell Inc., Electronic Data Systems Corp. and International Business Machines Corp., all of which have invested large amounts of funds in facilities in Ireland.</p>
<p>&quot;Ireland has become the market leader for U.S. companies undertaking greenfield investment into Europe,&quot; McGowan said, noting that 30 percent of all such projects now come to Ireland.</p>
<p>Such is Ireland's success that income from multinationals now supports one in three people in the country's manufacturing labour force.</p>
<p>The nation's coffers are reaping billions of dollars in corporation taxes from overseas companies, who account for three-quarters of manufacturing exports and half of total exports out of Ireland.</p>
<p>&quot;The impact of overseas companies in the economy has increased substantially, with exports of 12.6 billion Irish pounds ($19.8 billion) and the Irish economy expenditures of 4.4 billion Irish pounds ($6.9 billion), generating very significant downstream employment,&quot; McGowan said.</p>
<p>He said there were many spinoffs as well, including the growth in linkages between overseas companies and indigenous firms.</p>
<p>&quot;Purchasing of Irish-made components and raw materials has reached 1.3 billion Irish pounds ($2 billion) per annum, nearly 90 percent growth over six years and spending on Irish services is 1.4 billion Irish pounds ($2.2 billion), which means 60 percent growth over six years,&quot; the IDA said.</p>
<p>McGowan said both of these give rise to substantial employment growth in Irish service and supplier companies, and multinationals now employ in excess of 97,000 workers.</p>
<p>The IDA said Ireland's success in the highly competitive area of attracting inward investment was based on four pillars of strength.</p>
<p>First, the high level of qualifications and skills in the workforce; second, the existence of a special 10 percent rate of corporation tax; third, the flexibility and adaptability of the workforce and finally, the pulling power of the existing &quot;blue-chip&quot; companies already operating successfully in Ireland.</p>
<p>One of Ireland's biggest investors, Intel Corp., located in California's Silicon Valley, has committed a total of $2.5 billion to its Irish division's development, Intel Ireland Ltd., and is now the biggest supplier of semi-conductors to Europe from its Irish base.</p>
<p>General manager Intel Ireland Frank McCabe said the firm chose Ireland primarily because of its close proximity to Europe. He said other key factors were being able to hire the &quot;best and the brightest&quot; of Ireland's highly educated graduates in an environment conducive to agility, speed and flexibility.</p>
<p>McCabe said the special tax rate was of course relevant, but would not be drawn on what the company would do if Ireland's low tax incentive, which is due to be reviewed in 2010, ceased.</p>
<p>He pointed out that the Irish exchequer (treasury) received large sums in tax revenue from multinationals like Intel Ireland despite the low rate of tax.</p>
<p>However, many people fear a mass exodus out of Ireland by multinationals or at least a vastly reduced success rate if Ireland loses its special tax incentive.</p>
