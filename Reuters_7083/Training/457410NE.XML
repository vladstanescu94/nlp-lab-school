<title>USA: Judge denies Cadence motion, Avant stock rises.</title>
<headline>Judge denies Cadence motion, Avant stock rises.</headline>
<dateline>PALO ALTO, Calif.</dateline>

<p>Avant Corp. said Wednesday that a federal judge has denied Cadence Design Systems Inc.'s motion to stop the company from selling chip-design software products that allegedly use programming stolen by Avant.</p>
<p>However, the judge ruled that Cadence can press ahead for a trial.</p>
<p>The news boosted Avant's stock by $2 or more than 8 percent to $26.75 on Nasdaq. Cadence fell 87.5 cents to $32 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Both companies sell software that helps engineers design the intricate layouts of computer chips. Cadence is suing Avant for allegedly stealing some of its programming codes and using them in its own products.</p>
<p>Both Avant and Cadence claimed victory.</p>
<p>&quot;It means our customers can continue to license our products and we can continue to support them,&quot; said Vic Kulkarni, vice president of marketing at Avant, based in Sunnyvale, Calif. &quot;It's back to business as usual, which removes the cloud that Cadence was trying to put over us.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe Costello, chief executive of Cadence, said that the judge sided with Cadence, ruling that Avant did use Cadence programming in some of its products.</p>
<p>&quot;It sets a lot of the groundwork so we can start the engines again and move this thing as fast as we can to a trial,&quot; Costello said.</p>
<p>Cadence will try again in a trial to stop Avant from selling its chief products, he said. Cadence also is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.</p>
<p>Avant was formed in 1991 when four engineers left Cadence to form their own company. Other Cadence employees also left for Avant, allegedly bringing with them chunks of Cadence programming.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley companies are watching the Cadence lawsuit closely because it could set an important precedent in cases where key engineers leave to join competitors.  </p>
<p>The new computer can also check for electronic mail and enables Hawking to send e-mail and browse the World Wide Web. Soon Hawking will also be able to use it to manage remote controls for lights and doors, as well as his entertainment systems.</p>
<p>&quot;He says that he's got immediate access, so he must be one of the most connected people in the world,&quot; Nachtsheim said.</p>
<p>Hawking suffers from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or Motor Neuron Disease, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and is confined to a wheelchair and can only speak with the aid of a voice synthesiser.</p>
<p>However, he travels extensively and has even made an appearance on an episode of the American television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;.</p>
<p>Intel could not immediately say whether the new equipment will overcome one little gripe that Hawking, who is British, frequently repeats to audiences around the world -- that his speech sythesizer has a bit of an American accent.</p>
