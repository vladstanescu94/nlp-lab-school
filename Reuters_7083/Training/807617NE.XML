<p>Calif. Gov. Pete Wilson launched a $1 billion initiative Tuesday to bring on-line access to every public high school classroom in the state over the next four years.</p>
<p>Wilson, who made the announcement at the headquarters of network computing giant Oracle Corp, said the so-called &quot;Digital High School&quot; scheme would give California students a competitive edge in the global marketplace.</p>
<p>&quot;Children who aren't exposed to technology at a young age will enter college or the workplace at a serious disadvantage,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;That's why I've insisted that we bring California's classrooms on-line with the tools and technology of the information age.&quot;</p>
<p>Wilson's initiative not only will put more computers in classrooms but will also ensure that students are taught to be technologically literate.</p>
<p>California's Silicon Valley serves as the home base of many of the world's leading computer firms, including Oracle. But despite its reputation as a high-tech mecca, California still ranks 45th out of 50 in terms of students' access to computer technology.</p>
<p>The program will provide $500 million in state funds over four years, with a local match requirement doubling its value to $1 billion.</p>
<p>Specifically, the state will give technology installation grants of $300 per student in selected high schools. To earn a grant from the state, a school must first find matching funds and commit to installing the computers within two years.</p>
<p>The first phase of the program will be funded with $100 million in the state's 1997-98 budget, which Wilson signed Monday. That sum will help fund grants for about a quarter of the state's 840 high schools to install new computer systems within 24 months.</p>
<p>Oracle will donate $10 million over the next four to five years to help California schools in low-income areas.</p>
