<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Techs highlight scattered trade.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-02-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Individual equity options trading was widely scattered Thursday, with the only trend a continued focus on technology stocks, traders said.</p>
<p>Most options volume was seen in leading issues including Intel Corp, Microsoft Corp and International Business Machines Corp.</p>
<p>But one broker said he had sold a sizable amount of U.S. Robotics Corp puts and another said he had been busy swapping some Informix Corp puts for calls.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been pretty scattered,&quot; one said. &quot;Kind of quiet but steady, not hectic.&quot;  </p>
<p>Traders and brokers said the pace of investors rolling soon-to-expire February options into March was picking up.</p>
<p>&quot;We're doing some rolling now, but the majojrity of people start doing it tomorrow,&quot; said Hank Nothnagel, senior vice president of options trading at EVEREN Securities.</p>
<p>One broker said many of his clients had exited their February positions last week, well ahead of the expiration.</p>
<p>&quot;That's good because when you try to jam it all in at the last possible minute, you always get hurt,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>He said he had sold some February calls and bought March puts in Informix, which was down 13/16 at 17-13/16 in late trading.</p>
<p>The other broker said he had been selling mostly February puts in U.S. Robotics, which was off 3/4 at 59-3/4.</p>
<p>Activity in Intel options was centered on the February series, led by the February 150 puts, which traded 7,575 contracts. The option, which had open interest of 13,981 contracts, was up 1-1/4 at 1-5/8.</p>
<p>Other active Intel options in the February series included the 145 puts and the 150 and 155 calls.  </p>
<p>The busiest Intel option in the March series was the 155 call, which traded about 3,160 contracts.</p>
<p>Outside the technology group, an investor was a big seller of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp June 40 call, which traded about 5,505 contracts. The bulk of the volume was done in a block of 5,000.</p>
<p>RJR Nabisco shares were down 1/4 at 37-1/2 in late trade.</p>
