<headline>AFTER THE BELL - 3Com stock dips on Q4 earnings.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>3Com Corp stock slipped by more than a point after the U.S. market close, dealers said Tuesday, while most stocks remained in line with closing prices.</p>
<p>Traders said the computer networking company traded at 48-1/2, dipping below its unofficial close of 49-3/4, after reporting fourth quarter earnings of $0.48 per share, matching analysts' estimates, compared with $0.46 in the year-ago period, before charges.</p>
<p>3Com also said its revenues rose to $830 million, compared with $660 million for the year-ago period.  </p>
<p>Also active in after-hours trading was Parametric Technology Corp, which saw its stock fall to 39 from an unofficial close of 41-1/2, traders said.</p>
<p>The software tool company's stocks also slipped three points in late May after the company said it was comfortable with fiscal 1998 earnings estimates that were less than expectation.</p>
<p>Data storage company Imation Corp remained halted after hours, while the company reported that its second quarters earnings per share would likely come in below analysts' estimates of $0.30 to $0.38.</p>
<p>Otherwise, stocks prices were steady. &quot;We finished the day on a strong note and nothing is jumping out,&quot; a trader said, referring to a spectacular rally during regular hours trading.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to 7758 Tuesday, gaining 154 points, or 2.02 percent. The gain retraced most of Monday's heavy losses reflected in a 192-point drop in the blue-chip average.</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange said session one volume fell to 9,000, compared with 250,600 the previous day. Session two volume hit 11,410,040, compared with 5,359,555.</p>
