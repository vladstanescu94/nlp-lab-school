<title>USA: Navarre Q3 hit by music retail problems.</title>

<p>Navarre Corp said Thursday that record sales for its fiscal third quarter were not enough to offset the continued financial difficulties in the music retailing industry.</p>
<p>Navarre, which provides content for the Internet and publishes and distributes music, software and interactive CD-ROM products, reported a third quarter net loss of $0.17 a share versus a profit of $0.15 a share last year.</p>
<p>The loss, which includes a $2 million provision, was for the quarter ended December 31. Excluding the provision, Navarre earned $0.01 a share for the quarter.  </p>
<p>&quot;(O)ur sales for the quarter were at record levels, but the lack of growth in the music industry and continuing financial difficulties of music retailers had a negative effect on the quarter's profitability,&quot; Eric Paulson, chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Last month the company warned that its results would be below last year's due to the higher percentage of sales from lower gross margin products and an expected loss from NetRadio Network, in which Navarre holds a 50 percent stake.</p>
<p>Sales for the quarter were $69.62 million versus $57.06 million the previous year. The company said sales were boosted by its computer products division, which reported a 39 percent rise in net sales for the quarter but has lower margins.</p>
<p>The company said it also made a decision to offer prepayment terms to certain customers, which hurt earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of these actions, however, we believe we are appropriately positioned to weather the continued weakness and the financial uncertainties facing the retail music business,&quot; Paulson said.</p>
