<headline>US OPTIONS FOCUS/IBM volume up after split.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>A two-for-one stock split in International Business Machines Corp took effect Wednesday and drew heavy interest to both the stock and the options, traders said.</p>
<p>In early afternoon activity, IBM was the third most active stock on the New York Stock Exchange, with more than 3.8 million shares changing hands. Consolidated volume topped 5.2 million shares.</p>
<p>The stock gained 1-5/8 to 91-1/4.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think you'll see a significant increase in IBM volume because of the split,&quot; said Jon Najarian, president of Mercury Trading, the designated primary market maker for IBM options. &quot;There are just more players able to trade $3 and $4 options than there are $6 and $8.&quot;</p>
<p>The IBM June 92-1/2 call traded more than 8,300 contracts, making it the most active. It was trading at 2-3/4.</p>
<p>The June 90 call traded about 7,640 contracts and the June 87-1/2 call traded more than 5,200.</p>
<p>Among puts, the June 85 was most active, with turnover of rougly 1,380 contracts.  </p>
<p>Trading was also heavy in the IBM July calls, led by the 95, which traded more than 3,400 contracts.</p>
<p>&quot;After the split, we've had some people closing out positions and some putting on new ones,&quot; said Rod Jamieson at Everen Securities.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Bay Networks Inc options were fairly busy as the stock rallied after a SoundView Financial Group analyst raised his rating on the stock to short-term buy from hold and increased fiscal 1997 and 1998 earnings estimates.</p>
<p>The analyst maintained a long-term hold.</p>
<p>Bay Networks shares were up two at 24-3/4.  </p>
<p>&quot;When they talk on high techs, everyone listens,&quot; Najarian said, referring to SoundView.</p>
<p>He said an institution was a big buyer of the Bay Networks June and July 25 calls.</p>
<p>The June 25 call traded 3,525 contracts and the July 25 call traded about 1,680. Other actives included the June 22-1/2 call, with turnover of 1,235 contracts, and the June 20 call, with turnover of 875.</p>
<p>The most active put was the June 25, which traded roughly 390 contracts.</p>
<p>Traders said overall, individual equity options were quiet.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's very quiet,&quot; one options trader said. &quot;I think a lot of people are just waiting to see what happens with this market.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that technology stock options were active even when the rest of the market was quiet.</p>
<p>&quot;We were a little busy yesterday, but today is much quieter,&quot; another trader said.</p>
