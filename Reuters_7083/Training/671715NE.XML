<headline>SAP to take steps against insider trade.</headline>

<p>German software maker SAP AG, hit last month by an insider-trading investigation, said on Wednesday it would take steps to prevent illicit share dealing by employees and management.</p>
<p>The company was responding to an investigation last month by prosecutors that initially involved over 100 people, but now appears to focus on between five and 10.</p>
<p>An SAP spokesman confirmed a report in the weekly newsmagazine Capital that members of the company's management and supervisory boards would be required to make public their trades in SAP shares, and cease trading entirely in the three weeks before the company's quarterly earnings reports.</p>
<p>Capital, citing SAP chief executive Dietmar Hopp as its source, said the number of &quot;primary insiders&quot; in the company -- those who have direct access to the most important data on SAP's performance -- would be cut to 29 from 71.</p>
<p>The company also said that within three days of the end of a quarter it would announce results accurate to within five percent.</p>
<p>The spokesman said this would be especially true when the actual results clearly diverge from the planned figures.</p>
<p>&quot;The point is to inform the financial markets as early as possible,&quot; he said. The proposed measures are to be discussed by the supervisory board on July 23.</p>
<p>Insider trading has been punishable in Germany since 1994 by up to five years in prison.</p>
<p>Investigators have said members of the management board are no longer among the suspects in the current SAP case, which centres on a sharp drop in the company's share price around the time it slashed its 1996 earnings outlook last October.</p>
