<p>Computer Associates International Inc said on Tuesday at its North American revenues grew 33 percent in its December quarter, cushioning the blow of a pre-announced decline in European sales.</p>
<p>In a phone interview, Sanjay Kumar, CA's president and chief operating officer, said European revenues declined about 20 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>Total revenues for the fiscal third quarter ended December 31 were $1.05 billion against $1.00 billion in the December quarter of 1995.</p>
<p>Also, the executive said CA had become a &quot;big buyer&quot; of its own stock since the company's warning in late December of a revenue shortfall sent the stock price tumbling.</p>
<p>CA stock had been trading around record high levels of $67 and now is in the mid $40's.</p>
<p>Kumar said the revenue problem arose from the software maker's on-going transition to a client-server focus from its traditional mainframe base.</p>
<p>He said the mainframe-oriented European sales force was finding the switch to highly competitive open systems software a challenge.  </p>
<p>Kumar said he told Wall Street analysts in a conference call Tuesday evening that it could take a quarter and perhaps two quarters to put its European sales back on track.</p>
<p>&quot;We clearly need the current quarter to work through these issues,&quot; he said, referring to the fiscal fourth quarter ending in March.</p>
<p>&quot;My thinking at this point is that (I would like to have) the room if needed into the first quarter,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I told analysts that I am not doing anything short term just to grab some revenue,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>The CA executive said Italy and Spain continue to do well but France and Germany suffered the brunt of the sales downturn.</p>
<p>Asia/Pacific revenue growth was &quot;very strong&quot; with China growing 100 percent year over year.</p>
<p>Kumar said client/server revenues now account for 39 percent of CA's total with mainframe revenues making up the rest. Client/server revenues grew 43 percent year on year, he noted. &quot;I would clearly like to see us cross the 50-50 line in 1997, but it may take until 1998,&quot; he said, referring to the split between mainframe and client/server revenues.</p>
<p>In its third quarter earnings results, CA reported operating earnings of $0.75 a share, 25 percent above the December 1995 quarter's $0.60.</p>
<p>That excluded a pre-announced charge of $598 million for the acquisition of Cheyenne Software.</p>
