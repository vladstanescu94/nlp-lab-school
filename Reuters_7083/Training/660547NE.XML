<title>USA: CrossRoads to use IBM component technology.</title>

<p>CrossRoads Software Inc said it has agreed to use IBM's component broker technology as part of an alliance between the companies.</p>
<p>Privately held CrossRoads, which marked its formal corporate launch in San Francisco on Thursday, is developing software products designed to link disparate business application software from multiple vendors.</p>
<p>The company demonstrated an early &quot;alpha&quot; version of its first products, which will provide integration between front-office customer interaction systems and back-office enterprise resource planning (ERP) software.</p>
<p>CrossRoads executives said the company is due to begin customer testing of the initial product, with Bay Networks and Hewlett-Packard Co as initial test partners, later this month. Beta testing is expected in the third quarter and general availability is due in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Katrina Garnett, founder and chief executive of CrossRoads, said the company's system was designed using Sun Microsystems Inc's Java programming technology and is made to work directly &quot;out of the box.&quot;</p>
<p>The CrossRoads InterChange Server will run as a Microsoft Windows NT/BackOffice application, using Microsoft's COM and DCOM component object models as well as ActiveX to integrate application services.</p>
<p>The company will also use other Microsoft technology.</p>
<p>George Gilbert, an analyst at investment bankers Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said the market for licensing business application integration products such as CrossRoads is developing and could reach $4 billion by 2000.</p>
<p>The company's goal is ambitious, aiming to simplify and reduce the cost of patching together applications ranging from human resources and payroll tasks to manufacturing and financial functions.</p>
<p>Until now, companies operating more than one of these systems have had to create costly custom solutions to link the systems together, whereas CrossRoads aims to create a modular structure to link the programs automatically.</p>
