<p>Storm Technology Inc said Monday it expects to post a loss of between $0.11 and $0.13 a share in the fourth quarter, exceeding analysts estimates.</p>
<p>In a statement, the company said revenues for the fourth quarter of 1996 are also likely to be lower than the current consensus estimates of approximately $11.8 million.  </p>
<p>The company said analysts were looking for the company to post a loss of around $0.04 a share for the quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;While we expect substantial annual revenue growth in excess of 300 percent from 1995 to 1996, we will fall short of current fourth quarter and 1996 annual revenue and earnings estimates,&quot; William Krause, president and chief executive officer said. &quot;Sales growth for the fourth quarter of 1996 from the year earlier quarter is likely to be in the 160 percent to 180 percent range rather than the 300 percent growth of consensus estimates.&quot;  </p>
<p>The company attributed the majority of the shortfall to lower than expected seasonal sell-through of Storm's EasyPhoto Drive product in the retail channel. The remainder of the shortfall was due principally to a product transition for the EasyPhoto SmartPage product resulting in reseller stock outs during late November through early December.</p>
<p>&quot;While showing growth from third quarter results, sales of the EasyPhoto Reader product and OEM royalties did not offset the shortfalls in the other two products,&quot; Storm Technology said.</p>
<p>Since its initial release in August, 1996, the EasyPhoto Drive has been purchased by a smaller customer base than expected, the company said,adding it is increasing its focus on the Original Equipment Manufacturer, Value Added Reseller and system integrator channels, which are interested in pre-installing Easy-Photo Drive's into PCs sold into end-user markets.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to announce one to two additional OEM PC manufacturers in the first quarter of 1997, which intend to add the EasyPhoto Drive into their standard PC product offerings,&quot; the company said.</p>
