<title>USA: US OPTIONS FOCUS - April calls in tech stocks.</title>
<headline>US OPTIONS FOCUS - April calls in tech stocks.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>Technology stocks remained weak despite a sizable bounce in the broader indices this week, leaving a lot of April call positions in the sector hopeless ahead of Friday's expiration, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't remember ever seeing the Dow (Industrials) go up 135 points and Nasdaq (composite) go down,&quot; said Jay Shartsis, director of options trading, R.F. Lafferty &amp; Co, referring to Tuesday's huge divergence and similar gaps today.</p>
<p>The Dow .DJI was up 75.05 points at 6,662.21 and S&amp;P 500 index was up 7.60 to 762.38 in late trade today, while the Nasdaq composite was down 3.96 at 1,208.92.  </p>
<p>After the technology sector's steady decline in recent weeks, a lot of call speculators were unable to even roll Aprils over into further out months, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Probably a lot of people are trapped in April calls, and they're not getting bailed out so easily,&quot; Shartsis said.</p>
<p>&quot;I would think some people are rolling over into May but I also think a lot of people are hung on some of those higher-up April stuff,&quot; agreed Rod Jamieson, vice president of option strategies at EVEREN Securities.</p>
<p>Shartsis said tech stocks were likely to stay depressed until a possible reactionary rally after the expiration.  </p>
<p>But he added that many high-techs still had high potential to fall further and the long-term outlook was negative.</p>
<p>Concerns about first quarter earnings, which have started coming out, were said to be driving the tech stocks' weakness.</p>
<p>&quot;It sure looks like people are buying quality names with visible earnings versus the smaller stocks,&quot; Jamieson said.</p>
<p>Jesse Stamer of TradeNet, a designated primary market maker at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said a major destabilizing factors wa nervousness over International Business Machines Corp earnings due next week.  </p>
<p>Analysts have said a stronger dollar might have a negative impact on IBM's profits.</p>
<p>Microsoft Corp's earnings are due on Thursday, with forecasts of a 40 percent jump in first quarter earnings. But Jamieson noted that earnings seemed to hit technology stocks regardless of how good or bad they were. He cited selloffs in Intel Corp shares earlier in the week and Compaq Corp today despite fairly good numbers.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, speculative interest surrounding tobacco litigations spurred activity in Philip Morris Cos Inc puts and calls on the American Stock Exchange.  </p>
<p>The stock was up 4-3/8 to 43-1/4 in late trade on news tobacco companies were in talks with attorneys general of states suing them for healthcare costs, although some traders noted that a settlement could cost the industry tens or hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;Morris is such a difficult stock,&quot; Jamieson at EVEREN said. &quot;I don't know why it goes up but it does.&quot;</p>
<p>Apart from April puts and calls, which topped the AMEX most actives list due partly to rollover, speculation boosted turnover in May 45.0 calls, with volume of 5,081 lots, and June 40 and 41.625 puts, with about 4,500 each.</p>
