<p>Software billionaire Larry Ellison said Tuesday he was putting off, for now, an attempt to gain control of troubled Apple Computer Inc.</p>
<p>In a brief statement, Ellison, who is chairman of database software maker Oracle Corp., did not let Apple off the hook entirely, saying he might decide to buy Apple stock for investment purposes or reconsider the possibility of acquiring the company sometime in the future.</p>
<p>Ellison, who has been critical of Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio's strategy for turning around the computer maker, has expressed an interest in buying Apple with his own money for more than two years. Based on current share prices, a purchase of Apple would cost about $2.1 billion.</p>
<p>Last month the flamboyant executive approached unidentified big investors about a joint bid, and said he was also discussing the idea with his friend Steven Jobs, the Apple co-founder who was kicked out of the company in 1985 and returned in December as a part-time adviser to Amelio.</p>
<p>The move put Jobs in the uncomfortable position of having to deny any interest in ousting Amelio.</p>
<p>Ellison's interest in buying Apple comes as the Cupertino, Calif.-based computer maker is struggling to recapture a profitable role in the intensely competitive PC industry and prevent Microsoft Corp. from completely dominating the market.</p>
<p>Ellison has talked of plans to turn Apple into a supplier of stripped-down, low-cost network computers that can access the Internet. Ellison has been a major promoter of the so-called network computer concept.</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, Oracle President Raymond Lane said Apple had missed its chance to prosper in the personal computer boom and would be best served by focusing on network computers.</p>
<p>&quot;They may find a new light in network computers, and education markets they're still strong in, but in PCs, it's over,&quot; Lane told Reuters at a conference. &quot;It's a monopoly,&quot; he said referring to Microsoft's grip on the industry.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Ellison declined to elaborate Tuesday on his decision not to pursue the acquisition.</p>
<p>Apple, which virtually invented the personal computer 20 years ago, has struggled recently. Earlier this month Apple posted a second quarter loss of $708 million, reflecting one-times charges for acquiring Job's software firm Next Software Inc. and for laying off a third of its workforce.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Dataquest, which tracks computer sales for the industry, said Apple dropped off the top five list in worldwide PC sales for the first quarter, the first time Apple has not been among the leading PC sellers.</p>
<p>Apple executives have vowed to turn the company around and return to profitability by the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts have warned that even in better financial health, Apple faces serious problems. The number of Apple computers shipped worldwide in the second quarter plunged 33 percent to 602,000 units, a drop that was bigger than most forecasts.</p>
<p>Apple, fearing a takeover from Ellison recently hired investment banker Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. to provide advice. The company was not immediately available for comment on Tuesday.</p>
