<p>Digital Equipment Corp. slashed prices Thursday by up to 47 percent on workstations and network computers powered by its Alpha microprocessor in a bid to win customers from competitors.</p>
<p>Digital specifically mentioned rivals Sun Microsystems and Compaq Computer and said it offers the same or better computing power for the same price.</p>
<p>&quot;Our expectation is this will allow us to increase share,&quot; said Harry Copperman, vice president of Digital's systems business unit, in an interview. &quot;This price announcement clearly ups the ante for our competitors.&quot;</p>
<p>The main customers for the computers, which can cost from a few thousand to hundreds of thousands of dollars, typically are engineers and designers at businesses such as aircraft manufacturers and automakers.</p>
<p>Digital has long boasted a technological edge over its competitors with its fast 64-bit Alpha microprocessor, but has had difficulty transfering that leaderership into sales.</p>
<p>According to Andrew Allison, publisher of the newsletter &quot;Inside the New Computer Industry&quot;, revenue from Digital's Alpha computer systems running on the Unix operating system grew by about 50 percent in 1996. But Digital still only accounted for 8.9 percent or about $4.5 billion of the market for chips designed to run high-speed computer workstations.</p>
<p>Now many of Digital's established competitors in that market, including Sun, IBM and Hewlett-Packard Co., have introduced their own 64-bit microprocessors.</p>
<p>In addition, Compaq and systems based on Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT operating system and Intel Corp.'s chips, together known as &quot;Wintel&quot;, have been making headway in the market, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;You've seen us for the last two years assert our leadership in terms of performance,&quot; Copperman said. &quot;Now you're seeing the company become very aggressive in terms of price leadership.&quot;</p>
<p>The AlphaServer price cuts are effective worldwide, while the reductions on prices for Digital's AlphaStations apply in Europe and the United States, the company said.</p>
<p>Among the cuts, the price of Digital's midrange AlphaServer 4000 5/300 system with 512 megabytes of random access memory, or RAM, will drop 47 percent to $31,500. Digital's AlphaServer 8200 5/440 with two gigabytes of memory falls 20 percent to $224,400.</p>
<p>Digital also said it introduced new server configurations that provide as much as four times the memory of current systems at little or no extra cost.</p>
<p>Digital's stock fell $1 to $35.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
