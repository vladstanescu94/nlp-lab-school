<headline>RESEARCH ALERT - Cimatron buy repeated.</headline>
<text>
<p>-- Needham &amp; Co analyst John Barr said he repeated a buy rating on Cimatron Ltd.</p>
<p>-- He said he reduced his earnings estimate for the company to $0.05 per share from $0.11 for the third quarter, and to $0.40 from $0.50 for 1996. He also reduced his revenue estimate to $17.2 million from $17.9 million for 1996.</p>
<p>-- Cimatron said Friday its third quarter results would be significantly lower than analysts' estimates. It said much of the anticipated decrease results from about $700,000 in expenses for Cimatron Technologies Inc, which is trying to expand the company's North American distribution network.</p>
<p>-- Barr said the &quot;circumstances are not nearly as severe as the announcement indicated&quot;. He said about half of the expenses comes from a &quot;one-time reclassification of maintenance revenues at a distributor,&quot; which Cimatron does not own.</p>
<p>-- Barr said the company's cash and securities are estimated about $1.70 per share, and said the stock is valued at less than two times 1997 earnings. He said the company is growing at about 30 percent per year.</p>
<p>-- Cimatron stock rose 1-3/16 to 3-15/16.</p>
