<title>USA: Check Point keeps focus on market share.</title>
<headline>Check Point keeps focus on market share.</headline>

<p>Check Point Software Technologies Ltd said the average price for its products continued to rise in 1996 and any future pricing pressure would likely affect low-end products, the chief executive of its U.S. operations said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very focused on market share,&quot; Dr. Deborah Triant, chief executive and president of Check Pont Software Technologies Inc said in an interview.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're very fortunate, given the operating margins that we have enjoyed up to this point, to be in a better position than most others to take pricing action should that become necessary,&quot; she said.  </p>
<p>Check Point shares, which rose 32 percent in Nasdaq trade on Thursday, slipped 7/8 to to close at 26-3/4 on Friday.</p>
<p>The company posted gross margins of 94 percent in the December quarter, up slightly from its 92 percent in the third quarter. Check Point's high-end enterprise system, which sells for around $19,000 each, accounts for about 50 percent of the company's overall revenues.</p>
<p>Check Point leads the market for firewalls, which corporations use to protect their internal networks from unwanted or illegal intrusions.  </p>
<p>The company also sells lower-end versions of its system for under $5,000, and it continues to look for new categories of customers who are interested in the technology.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to look at the segment and if we see a customer segment interested in an even lower-end version, we will do so,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>One industry analyst, UBS Securities' Gibbs Moody, upgraded the stock to a &quot;buy&quot; rating from &quot;hold&quot; after the results announcement. Moody predicted that Check Point would maintain its lead in the firewall market.  </p>
<p>Triant said the company would continue to diversify its sales and distribution, although it would still support &quot;healthful&quot; growth of its sales through Sun Microsystems Inc's Sunsoft unit.</p>
<p>Revenues through Sunsoft grew 41 percent in the fourth quarter in absolute dollar value terms, accounting for 34 percent of overall revenues.</p>
<p>Channel diversification, including new partnerships with Westcon and Ingram Micro Inc in the fourth quarter, enabled Check Point to reduce the portion of overall revenues generated through Sun, which had accounted for 58 percent of 1995 revenues.</p>
<p>The company also sells through U.S. Robotics Corp, NCR Corp, Hewlett-Packard Co and Bay Networks Inc.</p>
<p>Units shipped grew by 200 percent in 1996 from the prior year, with unit shipments in the quarter rising 37 percent.</p>
<p>Check Point is estimated to have a 40 percent share of the worldwide firewall market, according to an International Data Corp survey conducted last year.</p>
