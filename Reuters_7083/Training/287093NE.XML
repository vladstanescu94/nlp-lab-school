<p>Apple Computer Inc., citing weak consumer demand for some of its computers, said on Friday it expects to report an operating loss of as much as $150 million for the first quarter of fiscal 1997.</p>
<p>The troubled computer maker also said it plans further restructuring moves aimed at slashing another $1 billion in costs from its operations.</p>
<p>The warning, issued after the market had closed, is the latest sign of weakness in the personal computer industry. On Thursday, computer retailer CompUSA Inc. jolted investors when it said it expected a disappointingly small rise in sales in the fourth quarter because of weak PC sales. The Dallas-based company was the third major PC retailer in two weeks to report a weak outlook.</p>
<p>Industry analysts said PC companies that make machines geared toward home users, such as Apple, have been hurt by soft consumer demand and a lack of new features to spur buyers.</p>
<p>Unlike last year, when Microsoft Corp. released the Windows 95 operating system, there were no compelling new technologies in 1996 to drive consumers to stores.</p>
<p>&quot;Though consumer demand for personal computers in the U.S. was soft for the industry in general last quarter, the weakness in demand for Performa products in the U.S. is an obvious disappointment,&quot; said Fred Anderson, Apple's executive vice president and chief financial officer.</p>
<p>Performa is Apple's line of desktop computers aimed largely at consumers.</p>
<p>Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., said it expects to report an operating loss of $100 million to $150 million for the quarter when actual results are announced on Jan. 15. Revenues are expected to be down about 10 percent from the $2.3 billion reported in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>In the year-ago quarter, Apple posted a net loss of $69 million or 56 cents a share on revenues of $3.1 billion.</p>
<p>According to First Call, analysts had expected Apple to report a modest loss for the first quarter of about 4 cents a share, so the company's warning of a deeper loss is likely to surprise investors who had thought Apple's new management was starting to turn things around.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter, Apple reported a profit of $25 million, the first time the company had been in the black in a year.</p>
<p>Apple executives said the first-quarter loss is not a sign that the company's strategy is failing.</p>
<p>&quot;Our previously articulated three-year strategic plan remains sound, and we continue to lay the groundwork for the transformation of Apple,&quot; Apple Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gilbert Amelio said. &quot;Our pending acquisition of NeXT Software Inc. gives Apple the industry's most innovative and powerful Internet and software technology portfolio.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very pleased with the success in the first quarter of our PowerBook product transition,&quot; he added. &quot;Our disappointing Performa sales, however, dictate that we develop additional restructuring plans during the second fiscal quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;These results suggest that we need to reduce Apple's cost infrastructure so that we can achieve break-even results at a revenue level of $8 billion. We expect that the NeXT acquisition will contribute to this cost-reduction process by enabling us to bypass some costly internal R&amp;D activities.&quot;</p>
<p>Last month Apple announced plans to buy NeXT for $400 million in a bid to update Apple's next generation operating system. Previously, Apple had sought to break even at $9 billion in annual revenues.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Apple said he did not know if the latest restructuring moves would involve layoffs.</p>
<p>Last year, Apple announced plans to cut 1,300 jobs, or 8 percent of its total workforce, over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Apple's stock closed 75 cents lower at $21.75 on Nasdaq.</p>
