<p>Sony Corp is seeking an active role in Rupert Murdoch's Japanese satellite TV alliance, which will bring Sony lucrative new business opportunities, Sony's chief executive told Reuters on Thursday.</p>
<p>Nobuyuki Idei said talks on Sony investments in Japan Sky Broadcasting Co, or JSkyB, were still continuing but that Rupert Murdoch, chairman of Australia's News Corp, had basically agreed to Sony taking an active management role.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no intention of being a silent partner,&quot; Idei said in an exclusive interview.</p>
<p>He did not comment, however, on rumours that Sony would take a one-third stake in the 20 billion yen ($165 million) venture, making it an equal partner with Murdoch and Japanese publishing firm Softbank Corp.</p>
<p>Sony announced last week that it was in talks on investing in JSkyB, a satellite broadcasting venture that will start test broadcasts in Japan in April and launch a full 150-channel service early next year.</p>
<p>Idei said broadcasting will give Sony effective distribution channels for both content and hardware, such as set-top boxes and base stations, and allow the group to make coherent and strategic investments.</p>
<p>&quot;Broadcasting will bring us new business opportunities,&quot; he said. &quot;Just as Disney has ABC and Time Warner has CBS, it makes sense for a content provider to have a broadcast company,&quot; Idei said.</p>
<p>Idei declined to comment on whether the partnership with the News Corp would be extended into broader business areas, such as British Sky Broadcasting and American Sky Broadcasting.</p>
<p>&quot;Sony at first wants to succeed (in the broadcasting business) in Japan,&quot; Idei said.</p>
<p>Asked how Sony plans to raise the value of its content assets, Idei said it will set up more affiliates of Sony Pictures Entertainment in Japan and other parts of the world to produce TV programmes in local languages.</p>
<p>Sony already has such units in India and China.</p>
<p>But Idei said the timing was not right yet for listing Sony Pictures shares in the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;Going public is one option. But the strict rules imposed on listed companies would be a burden,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Turning to digital video disc, or DVD, technology, Idei said he believes it will take three or four years until the technology starts yielding sizable profits.</p>
<p>&quot;The jumbo jet is still taxiing to the runway, although it will move fast once it takes off,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A DVD resembles audio CDs, although it can hold up to 14 times as much information. It is expected eventually to replace prerecorded video movies, compact discs and CD-ROMs.</p>
<p>Sony will launch DVD players in Japan in March and expects a total of 40 million DVD players and DVD ROM-drive units to be in use worldwide by 2000, a much more conservative estimate than Toshiba Corp's 120 million units.</p>
<p>Asked when Sony planned to introduce a next generation, 64-bit version of its popular PlayStation home videogame machine, Idei said there was no need to hurry a new model to market at a time when sales of its current 32-bit model were booming.</p>
<p>&quot;We plan to continue selling the 32-bit model for at least another two to three years,&quot; he said. &quot;Changing models frequently is inconvenient for consumers.&quot;</p>
