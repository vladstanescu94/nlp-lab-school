<p>Apple Computer Inc has agreed to use Marimba Inc 's Castanet Tuner which allows users of Java software to get automatic updates of software and information over the Internet, Marimba said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Apple joins Netscape Communications Corp in endorsing Marimba's technology for automatically broadcasting over the Internet, said Marimba, which continues to seek deals with other companies including Microsoft Corp.</p>
<p>Marimba, a Palo Alto-based startup founded by developers of Sun Microsystems Inc's Java, has venture backing from Sun Micro and other companies through the Java Fund.  </p>
<p>Apple will bundle the Castanet Tuner with a version of its MAC OS Runtime for Java, Marimba said. It said Apple Chairman and Chief Executive Gil Amelio will provide details of plans to incorporate the Castanet Tuner at his keynote address to the MacWorld trade show here later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Robert Currie, vice president of engineering at Marimba, told Reuters that Amelio and Marimba President and Chief Executive Kim Polese will demonstrate an alpha version of the Castanet Tuner running on Apple's Macintosh system. A public beta version will be available from Marimba in the first quarter, and through Apple in the first half, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're talking with a variety of people,&quot; Currie said, with the objective of distributing the technology as broadly as possible.</p>
<p>Marimba wants &quot;to make sure the tuner's everywhere,&quot; he said, adding that the company is looking into embedding the technology in computers themselves, as well as in browsers and operating sytems. It is already working with five operating systems, including Microsoft's Windows 95, Windows NT and Sun's Solaris systems, with Mac OS coming soon.</p>
