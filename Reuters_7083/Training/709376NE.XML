<p>Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) project is being conceived with input from a phalanx of foreign computer companies, including networking firm Sun Microsystems Inc and software giant Microsoft Corp.</p>
<p>But there could be trouble in the proposed &quot;multimedia utopia&quot;. What else but a futuristic testbed for high-technology, high-speed communications products could bring such rival companies together?</p>
<p>The two U.S.-based companies are members of the MSC International Advisory Panel, a collection of over 30 top computer firms, mostly cobbled together personally by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.</p>
<p>RIVALS MAY SPAR IN MALAYSIAN CORRIDOR</p>
<p>Already arch-rivals on their home turf, there's been strong hints the jostling could carry on overseas in Malaysia.</p>
<p>On a Malaysian visit in June to launch a facility that promotes training in its own Java programming language, Sun Microsystems' chief executive Scott McNealy described Microsoft's Windows operating system as dead and said the MSC would be a part of the rivalry.</p>
<p>&quot;IBM won the first wave, Hewlett-Packard the second, Intel and Microsoft the third, and we're going to lead the charge ... against the dark side,&quot; McNealy said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to lead the rebel forces and I think the MSC is a very, very important component of the rebel forces,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Sun and Microsoft, which have both lined up support from other high-technology firms, not only battle on computer systems, but also on two versions of newly-launched stripped down, cheaper personal computers (PCs).</p>
<p>The Microsoft-Intel alliance is offering the NetPC, a diskless, sealable PC designed around Intel microprocessors, which can run most Microsoft software, and is aimed at corporate networks.</p>
<p>Sun Microsystems, Oracle Corp and others are promoting NCs or Network Computers, which are similar to NetPCs, but have only basic Internet and corporate network access functions.</p>
<p>Both sides have sniped at each other about the expected popularity of the new PCs which cost around $1,000, with Microsoft boss Bill Gates saying that NC stands for &quot;non-compatible&quot;.</p>
<p>MALAYSIANS HOLD ABOVE THE FRAY</p>
<p>So far, Malaysian government officials and high-technology industry players are nonchalant about the Sun-Microsoft infighting.</p>
<p>&quot;It takes an Asian to bring them together,&quot; chuckled Tengku Azzman Shariffadeen, chief executive of MIMOS Bhd, a key government player in the MSC project.</p>
<p>Asked recently if Malaysia was concerned about conflicting advice on the MSC from diametrically opposed philosophies, Tengku Azzman said: &quot;We just want to know what are their best ideas.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that at an early meeting of the panel, most of the ideas focused on broad strategies, not operating systems.</p>
<p>Dan Khoo, head of The Association of Computer Industry Malaysia, whose 220 members include foreign and local high-tech firms, said: &quot;It's not as if we are totally dependent on everybody. It's not like we cannot think for ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>HIGH-TECH ZONE DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN FIRMS</p>
<p>However, the success of the MSC is heavily dependent on the enthusiasm of foreign companies to participate in the project and guide it.</p>
<p>The 15-by-50 kilometre (9-by-30 mile) corridor will extend south from Malaysia's capital of Kuala Lumpur to its new international airport and include an &quot;intelligent&quot; city Cyberjaya and a new &quot;wired&quot; federal capital, Putrajaya.</p>
<p>About 40 firms, mostly foreign, have signed up to participate in the zone.</p>
<p>Including divergent viewpoints of the information technology future could help Malaysia hedge its bets on the project's success, some industry executives say.</p>
<p>&quot;The way the industry moves, you can never tell whose view of the world is right at any time,&quot; said Ramesh Gopal, business development manager at U.S. networking firm Cisco Systems Inc &quot;People are wary of single-views of the world.&quot;</p>
