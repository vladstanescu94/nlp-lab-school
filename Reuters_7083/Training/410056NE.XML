<p>A court on Friday passed Poland's first sentence for computer piracy, slapping fines and suspended jail terms on two software technicians convicted of selling illegally copied software and games, PAP news agency reported.</p>
<p>The regional court in the western city of Poznan imposed 18-month jail sentences, suspended for five years, and fines of 20,000 zlotys ($6,600) on the men, brothers who were identified only as Krzysztof and Wojciech B.</p>
<p>They had sold about 8,000 games and programs by catalogue and at computer markets in Warsaw and Poznan from 1994 until their arrest in April last year, PAP said.</p>
<p>In passing sentence, the judge said the offense was widely regarded as being unpunishable in Poland and had only recently begun to be seriously prosecuted.</p>
<p>Poland introduced a law in 1994 to end video, music and computer piracy, but there were widespread doubts about how effectively the under-resourced police could enforce it, especially as public opinion was ambiguous on the issue.</p>
