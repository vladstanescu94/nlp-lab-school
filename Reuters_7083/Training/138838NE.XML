<p>The chairman of German business software group SAP AG said on Wednesday that the stock market was overreacting to the company's nine month earnings report, which showed a sharp slow-down in growth rates.</p>
<p>Dietmar Hopp told Reuters in a telephone interview that the company now expects sales to rise around 30 percent this year and pre-tax profit would grow &quot;more than 30 percent&quot;.  </p>
<p>SAP says stock market reaction exaggerated =2</p>
<p>&quot;This reaction is completely exaggerated but is not unexpected. It is an expected correction after the rise of the past few weeks,&quot; said Hopp.</p>
<p>SAP reported earlier that sales growth slowed in the third quarter so that nine month turnover and profit expanded considerbly slower than expected, forcing the company to revise its outlook for the full year.</p>
<p>&quot;We presume that SAP will continue to show very stable growth. Sales growth this year will be just over 30 percent and pre-tax profit will grow more than sales, more than 30 percent,&quot; Hopp said.</p>
<p>He added that there would be no negative effect on the company's dividend.</p>
<p>&quot;We will still have higher profit so there is no reason for a negative impact. A negative effect would be a cut and a cut in the dividend is unthinkable,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hopp said the company was &quot;completely surprised&quot; by developments in the third quarter. Sales in September were 130 million marks below the level of June and it was still unclear why sales had slowed.</p>
<p>&quot;There were no sudden developments. Sales in September were well behind June. The sales cycle appears to be getting longer, customers need more time for their decisions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked whether the weakness in the third quarter could indicate that forecasts for the client-server market as a whole were too optimisitc, Hopp said: &quot;That conclusion seems likely if you also consider developments at other companies like Oracle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But we don't want to jump to conclusions now and say that the market isn't as big as we thought. It's just that booked orders were down in the last quarter,&quot; he added.</p>
