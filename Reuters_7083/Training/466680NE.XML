<p>Leading European business software group SAP AG said on Tuesday it expected sales to rise by 25 to 30 percent in 1997, although analysts were more optimistic because of the strong dollar.</p>
<p>The German company, whose shares have risen about 36 percent since the beginning of the year, also said pre-tax earnings would grow slightly faster than sales and reported that first-quarter business was developing as expected.</p>
<p>&quot;The increase in pre-tax profit should be one to two percentage points higher than the growth in sales,&quot; SAP board member Henning Kagermann told a news conference in Walldorf.</p>
<p>But analysts who follow the company's shares said rising sales in the United States could boost results even higher.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a bit more optimistic than SAP's forecast,&quot; said Michael Bahlmann at M.M. Warburg &amp; Co in Hamburg. &quot;They are not just a market leader in Germany. They have a lot of growth in the U.S. and Japan, and the strong dollar will help them.&quot;</p>
<p>Chief executive Dieter Hopp declined to give an outlook for the full year, but said SAP expected first-quarter results to be &quot;within the range of expectations&quot;.</p>
<p>SAP, whose R/3 software is used by companies to control manufacturing, personnel, accounting and other business data, did not plan any capital increase this year, Hopp said.</p>
<p>The company's shares closed floor trading up 50 pfennigs at 279 marks on Tuesday. Last autumn they fell to just above 200 marks after a surprise revenue drop in the third quarter.</p>
<p>SAP shares had the potential to rise to 330 marks over the next 12 to 18 months, Bank Julius Baer said in a report which gave the software maker a &quot;buy/outperform&quot; rating.</p>
<p>In 1996, favourable exchange rates boosted sales 58 million marks ($34 million) last year and operating earnings 18 million marks, SAP said. Its U.S. unit generated sales of 1.386 billion marks, compared to 1.799 billion in Europe, 465 million in Asia and 72 million in Africa.</p>
<p>As previously reported, SAP 1996 group sales were 3.72 billion marks, up 38 percent from the year before. Group net profit rose 40 percent to 567.5 million marks, while profit on ordinary activities climbed 43 percent to 967.2 million marks.</p>
<p>SAP planned to increase dividends for 1996 by 50 pfennig, boosting the payout on ordinary shares to 1.80 marks and preferred stock to 1.85 marks. For its 25th anniversary, it would also pay a bonus dividend of 50 pfennigs per share.</p>
<p>SAP also gave more details of its 1996 results, saying that cash flow adjusted according to the method used by German financial analysts rose 40 percent to 783 million marks, accounting for 21 percent of turnover.</p>
