<title>USA: Two bills offered to ease U.S. encryption exports.</title>
<headline>Two bills offered to ease U.S. encryption exports.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-02-27</dateline>

<p>Legislators introduced two bills on Thursday to overturn the Clinton administration's export limits on computer encryption technology, a key component of online commerce and global communications.</p>
<p>Encryption products, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software &quot;key,&quot; were once the realm of spies and generals.</p>
<p>But with the booming growth of the Internet, secret coding is now used for everything from keeping a business's E-mail confidential to protecting a consumer's credit card number if it is trasmitted online.  </p>
<p>Senators said export restrictions on encryption devices were hindering the development of the Internet and made it impossible for U.S. firms to compete with foreign companies.</p>
<p>The bills &quot;roll-back current restrictions on the export of strong cryptography so that high-tech U.S. firms are free to compete in the global marketplace and meet the demand of customers,&quot; Sen Pat Leahy, co-sponsor of both bills, said at a Capitol Hill news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;Online commerce will never reach its full potential under the policies of this and past administrations,&quot; Sen Conrad Burns, also a co-sponsor, said.  </p>
<p>The bills would generally allow a U.S. company to export a product with strong encryption features if similiar products were being offered for sale by a foreign supplier. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and Burns, Republican of Montanta, introduced similiar measures in the last Congress.</p>
<p>The government would still be permitted to restrict the export of encryption for military use or to countries posing terrorist threats.</p>
<p>The bills would write into law the current policy permitting unrestricted domestic use of encryption but one bill would criminalize the use of codes to obstruct justice.  </p>
<p>&quot;Both bills promote the freedom of this nation's fastest growing industry to provide customers here and abroad with products they demand,&quot; Robert Holleyman, president of the Business Software Alliance said. The group includes Microsoft Corp, International Business Machines' Lotus Development and Apple Computer, among others.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the most important privacy legislation before the Congress today,&quot; Jerry Berman, executive director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, said. Strongly opposed to mandatory key recovery, Berman said the policy ought to be &quot;my lock, my key.&quot;</p>
<p>The Clinton administration, which says key recovery is needed so the government can catch international criminals and terrorists, signaled its displeasure with the new bills.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to be disappointed with Senator Burns' approach because it does not balance the needs of individual privacy and economic growth with national security and public safety,&quot; Under Secretary of Commerce William Reinsch said Thursday. &quot;We believe there is a market for key recovery products from businesses who recognize the need for a backdoor to their own corporate data.&quot;</p>
