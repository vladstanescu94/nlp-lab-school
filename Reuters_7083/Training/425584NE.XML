<p>Europeans will be able to get their hands on a new generation of palm-sized computers this month, but even the computer industry's hype may not convince many to pocket them.</p>
<p>Six &quot;PC companions&quot; -- the first true Windows PCs in a palmtop package -- hit the market in the United States late last year and are due to be shown in Europe for the first time at Hanover's CeBIT computer fair from March 13-19.</p>
<p>But analysts say European techno-scepticism, poorly developed communications links, tiny keyboards, and the lingering shadow of Apple Computer Inc's spectacular Newton flop of 1994 -- were likely to keep the little machines from making a big splash.</p>
<p>&quot;For technophiles, they are neat little gadgets,&quot; said James Bates at market researcher Context in London. &quot;But it's still hard to see how they would appeal to the average person.&quot;</p>
<p>Six manufacturers have lined up to make handheld devices running the Windows CE software that Microsoft Corp developed to power a generation of pocket computers which use programmes that look and feel like familiar desktop PC software.</p>
<p>COMPAQ Computer Corp, Hewlett-Packard Co and Philips Electronics NV planned to show off the products at CeBIT, although they won't appear in European stores until later this year.</p>
<p>Japan's Casio Computer Co Ltd and NEC Corp and Korea's LG International Co Ltd also expected to have palmtops in Europe this year.</p>
<p>WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE AND WHAT THEY CAN DO</p>
<p>The machines weigh about 13 ounces, run for 20 hours on a pair of AA batteries and should sell for about 1,200 marks ($709).</p>
<p>Windows CE, a compact version of Windows 95, runs spreadsheets, electronic mail and calendar programmes that look just like those on full-grown computers -- so users can have PCs in their pockets anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>Compaq, the world's largest PC maker, thinks Windows compatibility will keep PC companions from repeating the Newton disaster, when Apple promised &quot;personal digital assistants&quot; would read human hand-writing, send faxes, and turn millions of people into computer-carrying converts.</p>
<p>&quot;This product offers everything Newton was supposed to be,&quot; CEO Eckard Pfeiffer told Reuters, although the Compaq PC Companion C120 does not read hand-writing.</p>
<p>Consumers, technology freaks and especially corporate road warriors -- those traveling salespeople who latch onto any technology that can help close a deal -- should be drawn in by the familiarity of Windows, Pfeiffer said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not an experiment. I think it will be both a mass market product and a corporate product,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Compaq was shipping thousands of PC Companions per month in the United States and was getting more orders than expected, he added.</p>
<p>ANALYSTS GUARDED</p>
<p>But analysts aren't ready to declare another computer revolution is at hand.</p>
<p>&quot;People didn't really have a great need for Newton, and whether there is a major market now still remains to be seen,&quot; Bates said. &quot;I'm not sure these products are much more than electronic date books.&quot;</p>
<p>Dataquest's Chris Jones agreed, in particular because Europeans already have digital GSM cellular phones, which can send e-mail, files and faxes from portable PCs. The analog cellular systems in the U.S. can't handle data reliably.</p>
<p>&quot;Who needs a PC companion if you have a GSM phone?&quot; Jones said. &quot;The GSM factor is a big one.&quot;</p>
<p>And limitations remain: little black-and-white screens, tiny keyboards and a shortage of data storage mean PC companions won't be up to the same kind of tasks as their desk-bound cousins, the analysts say.</p>
<p>On top of that, Europeans are more technology-shy than U.S. buyers, Jones said. &quot;Acceptance of technology has become quicker, but these products should do better in the U.S.&quot;</p>
<p>Even Hewlett Packard, which has sold palmtop PCs for six years, thinks the current market is limited to professionals like roving doctors and researchers collecting data in the field.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a revolution,&quot; said Sharon Coleman, HP's handheld product manager. &quot;The volumes for these products are nowhere near PC volumes. The consumer buy will be rare.&quot;</p>
<p>But the Newton vision of handheld devices wirelessly transmitting data from cafes and conference rooms would come eventually, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are entering the Internet century and the technology will get better,&quot; Coleman explained. &quot;The home market is at least five years away, but this is the future of computing.&quot;</p>
