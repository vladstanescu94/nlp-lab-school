<headline>US Rep Goodlatte introduces encryption export bill.</headline>

<p>Rep. Bob Goodlatte introduced a bill in the House of Representatives on Wednesady that would substantially relax U.S. export controls on encryption technology.</p>
<p>Identical to a measure the Virginia Republican introduced last year, the bill would allow U.S. companies to export powerful encryption programs, which use mathematical formulas to scramble data and render it unreadable without a password or software &quot;key.&quot;</p>
<p>Under Clinton administration policy, strong programs, used in online commerce and communications, cannot be exported.  </p>
<p>The bill, HR 695, had 55 co-sponsors, Goodlatte said.</p>
<p>Encryption is needed &quot;in order for the Internet to fully expand and reach its full potential,&quot; Goodlatte said a press briefing here. &quot;Encryption has always been used by governments but now it has to be brought down so this technology can be used universally.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. software companies have complained that they are losing business to foreign firms which can sell powerful encryption regardless of U.S. laws. They maintained that the current Clinton policy, which relaxed earlier export limits, did not go far enough.  </p>
<p>A similiar bill is expected to be introduced later this month in the Senate by Montana Republican Conrad Burns, who also introduced a bill on the issue last year.</p>
<p>Last year, the Clinton administration opposed bills on encryption exports introduced by Goodlatte and Burns and it is expected to take the same position this year.</p>
<p>In addition to relaxing export controls, Goodlatte's bill would also make it a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison to use encryption &quot;in the furtherance&quot; of committing any other crime.</p>
<p>The bill also writes into law the current U.S. policy allowing completely unrestricted use of powerful encryption domestically.</p>
