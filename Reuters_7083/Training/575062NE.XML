<headline>Maxxon Inc to merge with Cerro Mining.</headline>
<dateline>TULSA, Okla. 1997-05-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Maxxon Inc, a privately held company, said Monday it has signed a definitive agreement to merge with Cerro Mining Corp.</p>
<p>Maxxon said the agreement calls for an exchange of 7.578 million common shares of Cerro on a one-for-one basis for all of its issued and oustanding common shares.</p>
<p>It said all of the current directors and officers of Cerro have resigned, except for Thomas Moon, who will remain on the board which would now include Maxxon's current directors.  </p>
<p>Gifford Mabie, chairman of Maxxon, said the merger allows Maxxon to become capitalized more quickly and give the company's shareholders ownership in a publicly-traded firm.</p>
<p>&quot;Maxxon now has the opportunity to seek acquisitions in the medical device industry which will expand the operations of the company and increase value for its shareholders,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Maxxon is developing a disposable safety syringe that automatically retracts the needle into the plunger after use, eliminating the risk of accidental injuries.</p>
<p>In April, Maxxon announced the proposed deal, saying that upon completion, Cerro's mining assets would be sold, Cerro's board members would resign and the name of the comkpany would be changed to Maxxon.</p>
<p>A Maxxon spokesman was not immediately available to comment.</p>
