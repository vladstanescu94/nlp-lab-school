<p>Phil White, chairman of struggling database software company Informix Corp., faced an hour of blistering questioning on Thursday from angry shareholders, some of whom called for his resignation.</p>
<p>&quot;I read an article in the San Francisco Chronicle this morning that said Informix laid off 100 people,&quot; shareholder Janis Acton told White during the annual shareholder meeting. &quot;I was sorry to see you weren't one of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Investors squarely blamed White for Informix's sinking fortunes in recent months.</p>
<p>The company reported an unexpected first-quarter loss of $140.1 million as revenue plunged 34 percent to $133.7 million. The company's stock closed at $8.563 Thursday -- about half of where it traded in late March before it reported the loss. Yesterday, Informix laid off 100 workers.</p>
<p>Informix, based in Menlo Park, California, writes database software, the computer programmes that act as libraries for giant corporate computer networks.</p>
<p>The company got in trouble earlier this year when it concentrated its marketing and technical resources on Universal Server, a new database product geared toward companies that need to store sound and video along with text and numbers. But not many customers need multimedia capabilities.</p>
<p>&quot;I take the blame for the stock decline,&quot; White said. &quot;I took credit when the stock when up.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he believes Informix's products are strong, which will help the company turn around quickly. He expects Universal Server sales to pick up in the second half of the year. About 1,200 customers are trying it out, he said.</p>
<p>A reorganized sales team also will aggresively pitch the company's established products. And Informix will concentrate on databases geared toward Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT networking software, a rapidly growing market, he said.</p>
<p>As he has told analysts, White reiterated that Informix could be profitable again by the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Do I think our stock price is undervalued? Absolutely,&quot; White said. &quot;It's now up to us in management to prove it.&quot;</p>
<p>But during the question and answer session, at least three investors asked White to consider resigning.</p>
<p>&quot;Absolutely not,&quot; White said in an interview afterwards.</p>
<p>However, at least one shareholder appeared unconvinced.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Informix has exquisite products,&quot; said Acton, who claimed to have lost $1 million on her Informix investment. &quot;The company will come back, in spite of Phil White.&quot;</p>
