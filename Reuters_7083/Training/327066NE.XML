<p>Sybase Inc chief executive officer Mitchell Kertzman said a slew of planned new products and revamped marketing should revive sales growth.</p>
<p>The company has returned to profitability with two back-to-back quarterly profits, including a fourth quarter $0.07 a share that slightly beat Wall Street's estimate.</p>
<p>However, revenues were almost flat in the fourth quarter at $267.8 million versus $267.3 million a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;We already started,&quot; Kertzman said when asked what Sybase will do to grow revenues. &quot;The real driver in 1997 will be a very strong line of products in virtually every area.&quot;  </p>
<p>Furthermore, Sybase reorganized its marketing approach, he said &quot;with a focus on some vertical markets and a stronger relationship with application vendors,&quot; Kertzman said.</p>
<p>He said the new products will span all Sybase's segments from database software, development tools and so-called middleware or software that layers between databases and applications to facilitate things.</p>
<p>Sybase won some large new contracts in the fourth quarter, including one with Federal Express Corp for a range of Sybase products and services. Although the companies would not disclose its value, Sybase said it is about its largest ever.  </p>
<p>Kertzman said that ongoing profitability is Sybase's goal. But he said he could not promise or predict profitability.</p>
<p>&quot;We are hoping and planning to be (profitable). The challenge is always is in the first quarter which typically has revenues down from the fourth quarter,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;No goal less than continued profitablity is acceptable,&quot; he continued.</p>
<p>He said Sybase's best market opportunity is sales of software for corporate intranets and distributed data markets.  </p>
<p>Sybase stumbled into the red unexpectedly in 1995's first quarter and since then has struggled to return to sustained profitability.</p>
<p>Kertzman was promoted to CEO last fall. He had been the CEO of PowerSoft before Sybase acquired it and afterward was second in command to former CEO Mark Hoffman.</p>
<p>Sybase competes in the enterprise database software market which has been growing about 30 percent a year.</p>
<p>Analysts had forecast a profit this quarter, since Sybase completed its restructuring and won some big contracts. Wall Street's mean estimate was $0.06 a share, said First Call Corp.</p>
