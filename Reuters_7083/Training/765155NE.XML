<headline>AFTER THE BELL - PLC up after Q2 results.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>PLC Systems rose a bit in after hours trading Wednesday following the company's release of second quarter earnings that were better than analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>PLC shares were moving at 14-5/16, up from a close of 13-15/16, traders said.</p>
<p>PLC shares lost over half their value Tuesday after a U.S. Food and Drug Administration panel recommended rejecting the company's Heart Laser System.  </p>
<p>&quot;The stock got beat up so bad. When it gets beat up that bad, even just a little bit of good news helps,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>PLC reported a second quarter loss of $0.16 a share. Wall Street had been expecting a $0.19 per share loss, according to First Call.</p>
<p>Also moving after the bell was JLG Industries, which was trading at 11-7/8, down from a close of 12-3/8.</p>
<p>The company issued warnings for its fourth quarter and fiscal 1998 results and announced a restructuring that included a 30 percent cut in its workforce.  </p>
<p>Macromedia shares fell, trading at 10-1/2, down from an 11-1/2 close after reporting a first quarter loss of $0.03 per share, below the consensus estimate of a $0.02 loss.</p>
<p>Dealers said other stocks were trading in-line with their closing prices, following a day of sharp gains on Wall Street. The Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all hit record highs, with the Dow jumping 80 to 8255 and the Nasdaq touching its first all-time high in two weeks.</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange said session one had volume of 2,100, compared with 3,200 Tuesday. Session two had volume of 2.9 million, compared with nearly 4.5 million.</p>
