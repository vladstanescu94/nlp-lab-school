<headline>ConnexT, Netscape team up in power market.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-11</dateline>

<p>ConnexT Corp, a private Seattle-based utility services company, and Netscape Communications Corp have agreed to jointly develop products aimed at a deregulated electricity industry, ConnexT president and CEO Maura O'Neill said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The alliance will use Netscape's client and server software and ConnexT's software applications to provide detailed information for the electricity industry.</p>
<p>O'Neill, in an interview with Reuters, said Netscape was a logical partner because of their extensive experience using open software to link data and user groups on the Internet, which will be the main highway for sharing data among the different sectors of the deregulated market.</p>
<p>A major incentive behind the move was California's decision to separate, or &quot;unbundle&quot;, service packages provided in the past by regulated utilities.</p>
<p>From January 1, 1998, the state will begin giving its commercial and industrial power customers the option of selecting who provides their electricity, metering, and billing services.</p>
<p>The need to process vast amounts of data flowing between power producers, metering, and billing companies especially opens opportunities for ConnexT and Netscape, O'Neill said.</p>
<p>Meter Manager, a new product developed by ConnexT for this market, is capable of monitoring and providing real-time load analysis, data handling and data validation.</p>
<p>Armed with this information, traditional utilities, independent power producers and energy service companies can design power packages to fit individual customers' electricity usage patterns, O'Neill said.</p>
<p>It would also give power marketers and service companies a wealth of user data to help them better manage market risk by more closely matching power purchases in the spot market with actual user demand.</p>
<p>&quot;Giving suppliers access to real-time load analysis would help eliminate over-nominations by creating a more efficient market,&quot; said O'Neill, referring to power providers' current tendency to buy more power and schedule its transmission than is actually needed to meet their delivery commitments.</p>
<p>While California is the first state to unbundle metering services, some 150 million electricity meters will eventually follow suit nationwide as each state hammers out a plan for breaking open their electricity markets.</p>
<p>&quot;And we will announce a series of products that we've developed with Netscape over the next few months,&quot; said O'Neill.</p>
