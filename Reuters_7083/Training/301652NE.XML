<headline>Netscape says shipped 1 million servers in 1996.</headline>

<p>Netscape Communications Corp said on Sunday it delivered one million Internet and intranet servers in 1996, although not all the deliveries generated revenue.</p>
<p>Netscape noted the delivery total included downgrades of free trial versions of the software as well as final versions for which it received revenue. It declined to break out the percentage of servers that generated revenue.  </p>
<p>The company said it sees accelerating momentum for the products, and identified Fortune 500 customers of its software for corporate intranets, internal networks based on Internet technology.</p>
<p>The clients included Lockheed Martin, United Technologies' Pratt and Whitney unit, Rockwell International, in addition to Chrysler Corp, Prudential Securities and US West.</p>
<p>&quot;It took Lotus Notes seven years to get a million seats and in our case it took us a year to get a million servers,&quot; said Srivats Sampath, vice president of server marketing.  </p>
<p>Netscape's announcement follows a turbulent week in which the company's stock fell more than 10 points -- around 19 percent -- in one session at mid-week after a Deutsche Morgan Grenfell analyst pared his rating to &quot;accumulate&quot; from a buy.</p>
<p>The analyst, William Gurley, cited challenges as Netscape shifts its business model and product pricing strategy. He also said he does not expect the company to provide its usual upside surprise with results for the fourth quarter of 1996.  </p>
<p>Citing the quiet period ahead of the results report due on January 28, Netscape officials have declined to comment on earnings. Netscape ended Friday at 45-3/4, down 2-5/8 on the day and off by 10-3/4 over the week.</p>
<p>Netscape officials said two more products in the new SuiteSpot 3.0 line will be available this week -- the final version of Netscape Proxy Server 2.5 and the beta version of its Netscape Collabra server.</p>
<p>Some analysts and rivals have said Netscape's focus on the corporate market will lead to longer sales cycles, slowing the rapid growth that drove Nescape's market valuation upward.  </p>
<p>Sampeth disputed that view, saying corporate customers &quot;no longer are in these long sales cycles where they really have to worry, am I locking myself into a vendor?&quot; He noted that Netscape's open standards mean &quot;If we don't provide them with the products they want, they can always go to someone else&quot; for software.</p>
<p>He gave examples in which Netscape claims its products helped clients achieve 1500 percent return on investment in short periods of time.</p>
<p>&quot;If I'm going to get that money back in three months I really cannot go wrong&quot; by buying Netscape products, he said.  </p>
<p>Several analysts expect Netscape to continue to do well since rival Microsoft Corp, the largest independent software company, has focussed its enormous resources on the Internet over the last year.</p>
<p>These analysts note that despite Microsoft's fierce competition, Netscape offers products that not only take advantage of Microsoft's Windows 95 and Windows NT, but also promise to connect computers using these to otherwise incompatible operating systems.</p>
<p>Steve Harmon, senior investment analyst at Mecklermedia's IWorld, said Netscape is &quot;doing really well on the server side.&quot;</p>
<p>Harmon said he thinks Netscape's success will continue partially because of &quot;the 'anything but Microsoft' brigade ... After 20 years of Microsoft people want a fresh face in the mix,&quot; he said. &quot;Say what you will, but that's a lot of it.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition, Netscape has &quot;a damned good product,&quot; Harmon said. &quot;Their product cycle is so rapid, and they're coming out with quality stuff.&quot;</p>
