<p>Apple Computer Inc could get a badly needed boost from California state lawmakers who are considering a bill to give struggling computer makers tax breaks.</p>
<p>The bill, by Sen. John Vasconcellos, would allow any California computer manufacturer that does not turn a profit to seek a partial sales and use tax refund from the state. The refunds could total up to $15 million.</p>
<p>Apple, based in San Jose, and AST Research Inc, based in Irvine, are the only unprofitable major personal computer makers in California.  </p>
<p>Apple Computer approached Vasconcellos earlier this year, urging him to introduce the tax measure, said Rand Martin, the senator's chief of staff.</p>
<p>In the past five quarters, Apple Computer has reported financial losses of close to $1 billion and has had two rounds of job cuts totalling 5,400.</p>
<p>Apple officials could not be reached immediately for comment on the bill.</p>
<p>Apple has been struggling to sell its computers in the face of competition against cheap PCs based on Microsoft Corp software and Intel Corp chips.  </p>
<p>The Vasconcellos tax bill was a spinoff on a state law that provides tax credits to manufacturers in California for their equipment purchases.</p>
<p>Under the new bill, struggling computer makers like Apple would be eligible for tax refunds beginning in 1998 to reimburse them for their equipment purchases.</p>
<p>The bill was expected to be voted on in the coming weeks in the state Senate Committee on Revenue and Taxation. Representatives from Apple and other computer makers were expected to testify in favor of the bill at that hearing.  </p>
<p>California tax officials estimated that the bill could cost the state's general fund about $6 million in 1998, $8 million in 1999 and $7 million in 2000.</p>
<p>Senator Vasconcellos, a Democrat, represents a large portion of Silicon Valley, where Apple Computer and other large technology companies are based.</p>
