<p>Microsoft Corp.'s fiscal third-quarter profit jumped 85 percent to $1.04 billion, well beyond analysts' expectations, on strength in its core business, including sales of its Office 97 upgrade, the world's largest software company reported Thursday.</p>
<p>Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown reiterated that he expects results in the current fourth quarter to be similar to the quarter ended March 31, which he termed &quot;sizzling.&quot;</p>
<p>But in an interview Brown also said he expects Microsoft's growth to slow over the next five quarters based on difficult comparisons with year-earlier quarters and a lack of planned major new upgrades.</p>
<p>Net income, equal to 79 cents a share, rose from earnings of $562 million a year ago, or 44 cents a share, in the third quarter. The number easily topped Wall Street's consensus analyst forecast of 64 cents a share, according to First Call.</p>
<p>Revenues totalled $3.21 billion, a 45 percent increase over the $2.21 billion racked up in the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average had predicted revenues of about $2.9 billion.</p>
<p>Microsoft released its latest results after financial markets closed. In after-hours trading, the Redmond, Wash.-based company's stock jumped $4.625 to $102.75 from its Nasdaq closing price, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Worldwide acceptance of Microsoft Office 97 ignited these outstanding results,&quot; Brown said in a statement.</p>
<p>Office 97, the latest upgrade of the company's best-selling software package, was launched in January. It combines &quot;productivity applications&quot; such as word processing and spreadsheets that accounted for an estimated $2 billion of the company's $8.7 billion in the prior fiscal year.</p>
<p>Brown said Microsoft also realised &quot;solid gains&quot; from sales of operating systems.</p>
<p>Microsoft makes the bulk of its money from &quot;platforms,&quot; including the operating systems preloaded onto new personal computers, which generate about one-third of the company's revenues.</p>
<p>&quot;However,&quot; Brown cautioned, &quot;incredible results like these are seldom duplicated, and we are mindful of the very tough comparisons we will have in fiscal 1998.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown said in the interview that the first quarter of fiscal 1998 could show a downturn from the fourth fiscal quarter of 1997. He said he expected results to rise sequentially after that.</p>
<p>Brown said he expected a spike in revenues from the Office 97 upgrade would begin to tail off in the current quarter, although deferred revenues from product shipped earlier would prevent a sequential downturn.</p>
<p>The next upgrade of Office will not be out until fiscal 1999, Brown said.</p>
<p>&quot;So, fiscal '98 is in the product cycle valley from a comparison standpoint, and that makes the comparison tough, even if business fundamentals are very good,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Brown said he expected the revenue surge from the Windows 95 operating system to begin to tail off soon now that the product has been out 20 months.</p>
<p>Brown said he was &quot;very excited&quot; about the long-term future but said the earnings bar had been raised to an &quot;all-time Olympic record.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't had very many quarters in which EPS (earnings pr share) went up 80 percent,&quot; he said. &quot;That's not a quarter-in, quarter-out type of thing. This is just an incredible quarter.&quot;</p>
