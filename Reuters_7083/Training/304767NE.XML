<headline>Netscape says did no key deals on Dec. 31.</headline>

<p>A spokeswoman for Netscape Communications Corp. on Tuesday rebutted an analyst's comments that the company had done major deals on New Years Eve in order to meet its fourth quarter financial objectives.</p>
<p>The Netscape spokeswoman said the company did complete some of its deals towards the end of the quarter, but denied it was pushing down to the wire to complete deals that would make a major impact on its financial results.</p>
<p>&quot;We did no deals that were of materially significant on December 31,&quot; she said, adding &quot;Sure, we did deals towards the end of the quarter, like everyone does.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier, Merrill Lynch analyst Bruce Smith said reiterated his neutral rating and said evidence from checks with industry sources that Netscape had been forced to do deals right up to the end of its quarter to meet its sales targets did not bode well for its ability to meet his 1997 financial estimates.</p>
<p>Smith said in a report that the quater had been &quot;severely back-end loaded&quot; and that he had heard of &quot;two major deals that were closed on December 31, one of which apparently closed late into the evening.</p>
<p>Despite a new record for Wall Street share indices, Netscape shares skidded sharply, losing more than 10 percent of their value to close at 42-1/4, down 4-1/2.</p>
<p>Netscape declined to comment further on the analyst's report, or to address financial details, citing restrictions ahead of the company's issuance of its fourth quarter earnings report, which is due on January 28.</p>
<p>The issue of whether Netscape's momentum is slowing has been a hot one on Wall Street this week. The stock tumbled more than 19 percent last Wednesday after a Deutsche Morgan Grenfell analyst warned the company may not produce its usual upside earnings surprise in reporting fourth quarter figures. Company officials have said momentum behind a new family of server and desktop products is growing, however.</p>
