<headline>Bay Networks reports fourth quarter loss.</headline>
<dateline>SANTA CLARA, Calif. 1997-07-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bay Networks Inc. on Tuesday reported a loss of $118 million for its fourth fiscal quarter, reflecting one-time charges associated with two acquisitions.</p>
<p>The maker of computer networking equipment said it lost $118 million, or 59 cents a share, in the three months ended in June, compared with a profit of $55.1 million, or 28 cents a share, a year ago. Revenues rose 1.4 percent to $543 million.</p>
<p>The latest quarterly results included a charge of $148.5 million for the write-off of costs associated with the acquisitions of Rapid City Communications and Isotro Network Management Inc.</p>
<p>Excluding the charge, net income for the fourth quarter would have been $30.5 million and earnings per share would have been 15 cents, the company said.</p>
<p>According to First Call, analysts had expected the company to report a profit of 12 cents a share before the one-time charges.</p>
<p>&quot;These results demonstrate that we are beginning to make progress,&quot; said company Chairman Dave House. &quot;During the past two quarters, we have put in place a number of programmes and processes throughout the company to improve our performance. We are pleased our efforts are beginning to show favourable results.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Going forward, we believe new products from Bay, including several currently in development, will position Bay to resume growth in revenues,&quot; he added. &quot;Combined with our ongoing focus on superior execution of the basics, we believe Bay Networks is building the capability to deliver further improvement in profitability in the coming quarters.&quot;</p>
<p>The company's stock rose $1.06 to $29.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
