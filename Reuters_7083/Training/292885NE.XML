<title>USA: US OPTIONS FOCUS/Netscape, Motorola are highlights.</title>
<headline>US OPTIONS FOCUS/Netscape, Motorola are highlights.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-01-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Options on technology companies Netscape Communications Corp and Motorola Inc saw brisk trade Wednesday, one after the stock fell sharply and one ahead of quarterly earnings.</p>
<p>By 1145 CST/1745 GMT, Netscape shares were off 9-3/8 at 49-3/8 on heavy turnover of 9.1 million shares after Deutsche Morgan Grenfell downgraded the stock to accumulate from buy.</p>
<p>The stock hit a session low of 49-1/4.</p>
<p>Traders said options investors appeared to take the drop in stride and were not positioning themselves for more losses.  </p>
<p>&quot;Our order flow is telling us it's a little overreaction,&quot; said Scott Kilrea of LETCO on the floor of the Chicago Board Options Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;There are more premium sellers than premium buyers and that would tell me the public doesn't think it's going to be as volatile as $8 or $9.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Netscape options volatilities rose slightly off the opening but came right back down.</p>
<p>Hank Nothnagel, senior vice president of options trading at EVEREN Securities in Chicago, said his options desk had crossed a considerable number of Netscape options.  </p>
<p>&quot;Surprisingly enough, we had a lot of call buyers,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't know if they're right or wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>Among Netscape calls, the January 55 traded a total of about 3,295 contracts, the January 50 traded about 2,790 and the January 60 call traded 681. The busiest put was the January 50, which traded roughly 2,780 contracts.</p>
<p>Netscape options trade on the CBOE, the American Stock Exchange, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Motorola gained two to 63-1/2 in heavy trading after Morgan Stanley raised its rating to outperform from neutral.  </p>
<p>The company is expected to post lower fourth quarter earnings after the market closes on Thursday, but analysts are looking for any signs of a rebound in new semiconductor orders and in its wireless phone business.</p>
<p>Traders said the options activity was skewed toward the call side, which was not surprising given the stock's rise.</p>
<p>The January 65 call was the most active, with volume of more than 4,300 contracts. The January 70 call traded about 2,430 and the January 60 call traded 1,665.</p>
<p>The most active Motorola put was the January 60, with volume of about 2,490 contracts.  </p>
<p>&quot;We haven't had any put buyers come in,&quot; one trader said, referring to Motorola and other technology companies slated to report earnings soon. &quot;That's pretty much where the risk is.&quot;</p>
<p>He said below-consensus earnings would likely cause sharp selloffs and strong earnings would lead to further rallies.</p>
<p>In other trading, some of the sharpest options moves were seen in Shiva Corp as the stock slumped 14-7/8 to 20 after a late Tuesday warning about fourth quarter earnings.</p>
<p>A call spread in Liposome Co Inc crossed 6,150 times in the May 17-1/2 and 4,320 times in the August 20. ((-G.Crawford, 312 408 8750/Email: derivatives@reuters.com))</p>
