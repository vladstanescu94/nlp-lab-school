<p>The House International Relations Committee on Tuesday approved a bill to relax strict U.S. export controls on computer encoding technology.</p>
<p>Lawmakers voting for the measure faced down a united front of Clinton administration law enforcement and national security officials who warned the bill would cripple their ability to catch criminals and spies.</p>
<p>The bill, written by Virginia Republican Bob Goodlatte, would lift restrictions on the export of powerful encryption products, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software &quot;key.&quot;</p>
<p>Encryption has become a critical means of protecting communications and electronic commerce over the Internet, but law enforcement agencies are concerned that the data scrambling could also be used to thwart their attempt to tap the lines of crooks.</p>
<p>The administration allows companies to export such programmes only if the products allow the government to crack the codes by gaining access to the software keys. Proponents of the bill said so-called key recovery schemes are unworkable and U.S. requirements would hand the market for encryption products over to foreign companies.</p>
<p>The bill was approved by the House Judiciary Comittee in May but is still a long way from becoming law. Several other committees in the House will consider the measure. The Senate is weighing legislation that would move in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Goodlatte said after the vote he expected the full House to vote on the measure before the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;There are other committees that have some peripheral juridiction over it and they have until early September to deal with the legislation,&quot; he said. &quot;Then it's my expectation it will come for a vote on the floor of the House sometime this fall.&quot;</p>
<p>Representatives of the FBI, Drug Enforcement Agency and National Security Association attended Tuesday's vote and urged rejection of the Goodlatte bill. Opponents also circulated a last-minute written appeal against the bill from Defence Secretary William Cohen.</p>
<p>Committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman, Republican of New York, agreed with those concerns and offered an amendment to give the president the authority to retain export controls on grounds of national security. The amendment was defeated on a 13-22 vote.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot be put in the position here of making mistakes, creating a proliferation of encryption that down the road ties the hands of our law enforcement and intelligence community,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Representative Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Connecticut, said the export controls did nothing to prevent criminals from using encryption. He noted that previous unilateral U.S. export controls on computers and machine tools simply allowed forgein companies to gain market share.</p>
<p>&quot;Any scoundral, any country that has its interest against the United States can walk into any store in any country and buy encryption software that will give our intelligence boys a heartache,&quot; Gejdenson said in an impassioned speech. &quot;The question is whether we're going to make believe we're doing something.&quot;</p>
