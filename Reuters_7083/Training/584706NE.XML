<p>Digital Equipment Corp said on Wednesday it did not see its business affected by its suit against Intel Corp for patent infringement.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no impact to us continuing to sell our products, no impact on our worldwide operations,&quot; Darke M. Sani, managing director of Digital Singapore told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said this was because Intel supplies chips to Digital on a long-term contract.</p>
<p>But he declined to say how the suit could affect relationship between the two companies on the corporate level.  </p>
<p>Digital filed a lawsuit in the United States late on Monday alleging that Intel, the world's largest computer chip maker, infringed on 10 Digital patents in all its versions of its Pentium, Pentium Pro and Pentium II chips.</p>
<p>Digital is seeking to force Intel to stop using its technology and &quot;quite huge&quot; damages.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Digital in Singapore introduced desktop personal computers and personal workstations based on Intel's Pentium chips, including its latest Pentium II microprocessor.  </p>
<p>It also launched workstations and servers based on its fastest Alpha 21164 microprocessor with a speed of 600 MHz that runs on both Unix and Windows NT operating systems.</p>
<p>Trevor Dodd, manager of workstation business segment for Southeast Asia, said Digital was supporting both Unix and Windows NT as industry expectations were that demand for workstation operating systems would be equal for both by 2000.</p>
<p>By that time, 40 percent of all computer systems would be based on Windows NT, Darke said.</p>
<p>Digital hoped to sell twice the volume of workstations in 1997 over 1996 in the ASEAN region, Dodd said.  </p>
<p>Revenues from workstations in Southeast Asia could then increase by 50 percent, he added, but declined to reveal revenue figures.</p>
<p>Digital's share of revenue from workstations in the region could reach 25 percent in 1997 and share in terms of units would be over 20 percent as well, Dodd said.</p>
<p>According to research firm International Data Corp's (IDC) report, Digital's workstation share had risen to 17.2 percent in the first three quarters of 1996 compared to 7.4 percent in the same period in 1995.  </p>
<p>In terms of revenues from workstations, Digital's share rose to 20.3 percent from 10.2 percent.</p>
<p>Officials said Digital was working with Microsoft Corp on the next version of Windows NT which would be 64-bit and this was expected to undergo beta testing at the end of 1997.</p>
