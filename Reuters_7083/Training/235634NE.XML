<p>U.S. computer giant Microsoft said on Wednesday that 99 percent of software in Vietnam was pirated and urged Hanoi to speed efforts to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>Microsoft's General Manager in Vietnam, Michael Davis, told Reuters a new industry survey showed the level of copyright violations in Vietnam exceeded that in China and was causing substantial losses for producers.</p>
<p>&quot;These new numbers are not very encouraging,&quot; he said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>&quot;Based on information we've received from new Business Software Alliance estimates we know it's (the losses) significant,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Davis said products such as Microsoft's MS Office were popular piracy targets, but operating systems such as Windows and DOS were relatively unaffected by the problem.</p>
<p>He said Hanoi was working on laws to resolve the problem but said the necessary regulations were not yet in place.</p>
<p>Microsoft's products retail in Vietnam at around the same price as in the United States. Windows 95 and Office 95 are available in Vietnamese language editions.</p>
<p>Vietnam is one of the world's poorest countries. According to recent World Bank estimates, per capita income is around $275 per year.</p>
<p>Despite this, computer sales are growing fast. Davis estimated that around 100,000 had been sold this year.</p>
<p>Vietnam issued a copyright law on July 1 and a decree on implementation was announced earlier this week. However, legal experts who have seen the decree say it contains no apparent reference to the protection of foreign works.</p>
