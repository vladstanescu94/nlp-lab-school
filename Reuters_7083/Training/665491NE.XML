<headline>AFTER THE BELL - Oracle shares hit snag.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Oracle Corp shares dipped by two points in after hours trading Monday after the company reported fourth quarter earnings spot on analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>Traders said the computer software company traded at 51-1/4, under an unofficial close of 53-1/4.</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter ended May 31, Oracle reported net income of $359.9 million, or $0.54 a share, compared with $266.3 million, or $0.40 a share, for the year-ago period.</p>
<p>According to First Call, analysts' consensus for the quarter was $0.54 a share.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jabil Circuit Inc saw shares power forward to 72 after the bell, up 3-1/8 from an unofficial close of 68-7/8, also trading on quarterly earnings.</p>
<p>The manufacturer of circuit board assemblies posted third quarter earnings of $22.1 million, or $0.76 a share, compared with $11.4 million, or $0.33 a share for the year ago period.</p>
<p>In addition to the strong earnings performance, which Jabil said exceeded its objective by more than four times, Jabil anticipated it would sustain its operating income growth rate through the next quarter.  </p>
<p>Otherwise stocks traded in line with their closing prices, traders said.</p>
<p>Technology companies also made news during regular hours trading. The Nasdaq composite index topped its previous record for a third straight day and rose 11 points to hit 1443 at the close of trading. The gain was attributed in part to continued strength in personal computer stocks.</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange said session one volume was 45,700 on Tuesday, up from 11,900 the previous day. Session two volume dipped to 2,175,046, compared with Monday's 4,915,302.</p>
