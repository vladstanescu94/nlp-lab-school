<p>Mitchell Kertzman, one quarter into the job as Sybase chief executive officer, said he accomplished the goals management set at the quarter's outset - to reduce expenses and produce an operating profit.</p>
<p>Sybase eked out an operating profit of $0.01 a share, or $6 million, up from $1 million in the year ago quarter.</p>
<p>That beat Wall Street's mean estimate of a loss of $0.06 a share as tallied by First Call.</p>
<p>(Corrects that company beat, rather than fell short of, mean estimate and changes that estimate from profit to loss).</p>
<p>But Kertzman, who took over as CEO on July 16, said now plans are in place to grow sales and with them, he is &quot;hopeful&quot; that profits will grow over the next few quarters.  </p>
<p>&quot;In this era of proposition 211, I'm reluctant to project we'll be profitable. But I am hopeful that over the next several quarters, we will make improvements in results, particularly profits,&quot; Kertzman said in an interview.</p>
<p>Proposition 211 is the California ballot initiative that would make corporate officers and board members personally liable for statements that shareholders construe as projections or reasons to invest in a company.</p>
<p>Kertzman said the third quarter profit was largely derived from cutting expenses by $23.8 million and a restructuring.</p>
<p>Future profit growth will need to come from sales, he said.</p>
