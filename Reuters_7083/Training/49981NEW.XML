<p>A low-cost network computer (NC) concept planned by Oracle Corp is unlikely to be a threat to conventional desktop personal computers, a senior official of computer-maker Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) said.</p>
<p>&quot;It (NC) is really a spinoff, with new needs and requirements,&quot; Tayfun Ugur, worldwide business development manager for commercial desktop computing, said at a news conference in the Indian capital on Thursday.</p>
<p>Oracle, which is hoping to build on its traditional expertise in database computing, said last week it would launch an aggressive advertising campaign next year to promote its NC as an alternative concept to personal computers (PCs).</p>
<p>The NC is expected to cost as little as $500 because it would be linked to central &quot;data warehouses&quot; which would help share functions conventionally done on a desktop computer.</p>
<p>International Business Machines Corp unveiled this month its first textbook sized NC priced at under $700.</p>
<p>Ugur said the NC would be more like a new product to meet some customer needs than an alternative to traditional PCs.</p>
<p>&quot;It is like comparing a truck with a small car,&quot; Ugur told Reuters after the news conference.</p>
<p>The NC is seen by industry officials as one of the new products emerging in a computer industry undergoing radical change with the fast growth of the Internet information superhighway.</p>
<p>HP officials said their company would soon launch computer network servers which would contain special software to offer easy gateways to the Internet.</p>
<p>The U.S.-based company is also focusing on local area network (LAN) products with Internet connectivity and expanding its printers and scanners to enable direct copying from Internet-linked computers, company officials said.</p>
