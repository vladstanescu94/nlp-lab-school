<headline>Internet consumer privacy initiative gets backing.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-09</dateline>

<p>A group of computer makers, software developers, telecommunications companies, retailers and publishers are backing an initiative to preserve consumer privacy and avoid government regulation on the Internet.</p>
<p>The initiative, called TRUSTe (formerly known as eTRUST), is a non-profit, industry-driven organization, based in Palo Alto, Calif. TRUSTe's goal is to promote electronic commerce by protecting consumer privacy and staving off regulation.</p>
<p>TRUSTe hopes to assure consumer privacy on the Internet by alerting consumers to the uses of their personal information through the use of &quot;trustmarks&quot; or logos, posted on Web sites.  </p>
<p>TRUSTe's partners include AT&amp;T Corp, International Business Machines Corp, Oracle Corp, Tandem Computers Inc, privately-held Wired Ventures, Netscape Communications Corp, Lands' End Inc, CyberCash Inc and many others.</p>
<p>TRUSTe was formed in July 1996 by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and some Internet companies and in October, 1996, it partnered with CommerceNet to implement its initiative.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, TRUSTe will announce the commercial availability of its program to use its branded trustmarks, which tell an individual how their information will be used.  </p>
<p>Companies can license the trustmarks for a licensing fee, which ranges from $500 to $5,000, depending on the size of the company and the sensitivity of the information.</p>
<p>The trustmarks tell a consumer that the information they reveal online will not be used by the Web site they are visiting; that their data is collected only by the site's owner for its use; or that their data is collected and provided to third parties but only with the user's knowledge and consent.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's akin to a 'Good Housekeeping Seal' online,&quot; said Susan Scott, executive direcor of TRUSTe. &quot;People are two to three times more likely to give information online if they know the use.&quot;</p>
<p>Scott also pointed to a study in March by the Boston Consulting Group, which said that concerns about privacy of personal information on the Internet is a consistent and significant concern for consumers online.</p>
<p>Web sites gather information about users through registration forms and commonly used software, known as &quot;cookies,&quot; which track the online travels of individual users.  </p>
<p>The Boston Consulting Group reported that in a survey, over 41 percent of respondents report leaving Web sites when asked to provide registration information over the Internet. In addition, another 27 percent provide false personal data.</p>
<p>The Boston Consulting Group estimated that as much as $6 billion in additional electronic commerce revenues could be gained by the year 2000, if privacy issues were addressed.</p>
<p>&quot;We want (the trustmarks) to be ubiquitous throughout the 'Net,&quot; Scott said. &quot;The consumer should have a choice.&quot;</p>
<p>TRUSTe said it will monitor its licensed Web site publishers to ensure the proper use of their trustmarks.</p>
