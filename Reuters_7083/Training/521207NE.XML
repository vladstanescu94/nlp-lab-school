<p>Apple Computer Inc is taking defensive steps in case of a hostile takeover bid, retaining investment banker Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co and Abernathy MacGregor Group, a public relations firm specializing in mergers and acquisitions, the Wall Street Journal said on Friday.</p>
<p>There have been signs Oracle Corp chairman Lawrence Ellison is considering making a bid for the computer maker. People close to Apple were quoted in the newspaper's electronic edition as saying Apple executives were not convinced Ellison's talk would turn into an offer, but were taking steps just in case.  </p>
<p>The newspaper said Ellison has talked to different people about running Apple. According to a person familiar with the matter, candidates included John Chen, chairman of Siemens</p>
<p>Ellison has also tried to pursuade major Apple institutional investors to go along with his plans, the paper said. According to a person familiar with the situation said Ellison offered to pay a modest premium for Apple shares, the Journal said.</p>
<p>Oracle and Apple were not immediately available for comment, and the Journal said Chen was also not available for comment because he was traveling.</p>
