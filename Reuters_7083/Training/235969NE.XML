<p>Shares in Cognos Inc eased further on Thursday after a rocky week kicked off by an analyst's downgrade based on price Tuesday.</p>
<p>Analysts said the stock is still fully valued and could come down further before being a good buy.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a real company but it's trading -- even after the recent correction -- at 53 times earnings,&quot; said Duncan Stewart, a portfolio manager at Tera Capital.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a great company. It's strictly that every stock has it's price. Even lousy stocks are cheap at the right price, and even great stocks are expensive at the right price.&quot;  </p>
<p>Cognos shares, which makes business intelligence software that allows effective database management, were off 0.50 at 42.25 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. They have fallen 9.50 since December 2.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say at C$35 it starts looking very attractive again and that's assuming them making their consensus numbers in terms of the earnings and assigning the long-term growth rate,&quot; Stewart added.</p>
<p>UBS Securities analyst Joseph Farley cut Cognos to a hold from a buy on December 3, saying the stock had reached his target price.</p>
