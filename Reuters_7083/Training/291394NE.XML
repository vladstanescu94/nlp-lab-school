<p>U.S. computer software company Oracle Corp said on Tuesday it had appointed India's NIIT Ltd as a sub-licencee to help NIIT offer systems integration services to a growing market in the Indian corporate sector.</p>
<p>&quot;Under the recently concluded agreement, NIIT will sub-license all Oracle products including core products and ERP (enterprise resource planning) applications suite along with specialised systems integration services,&quot; Oracle said in a statement.</p>
<p>NIIT, which is a leading computer education and training company in India, also has interests in computer consultancy and services. Oracle is the world's second largest software company after Microsoft Corp.</p>
<p>Systems integration involves building computer facilities linked to existing equipment and software, or setting up comprehensive computer systems to meet customer needs ranging from purchase to staff training.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel that they (NIIT) offer some unique skills and knowledge of the Indian market,&quot; Anil Kaul, managing director of the U.S. company's Indian arm, Oracle India Private Ltd, told a news conference in New Delhi.</p>
<p>The partnership would help NIIT, which has experience in South East Asian countries, offer combinations of computer hardware, software, applications and networking facilities, NIIT official Arvind Thakur said.</p>
<p>Thakur said NIIT was targeting a number of medium-sized and large Indian companies which were ready to make substantial investments in upgrading their computer infrastructure.</p>
<p>NIIT's revenue from systems integration services was expected to grow to 1.0 billion rupees in 1996/97 (October-September), from 350 million rupees in 1995/96, Thakur said.</p>
<p>Kaul said Oracle's agreement with NIIT would not preclude NIIT from offering solutions that might use products from other companies if that helped serve customers better.</p>
<p>&quot;None of us believe in tying people to a particular set of products,&quot; Kaul said.</p>
