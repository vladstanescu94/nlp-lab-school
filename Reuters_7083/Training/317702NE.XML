<headline>WALL ST WEEK AHEAD/IBM earnings, trend continues.</headline>

<p>Fourth quarter earnings from International Business Machines Corp will be the centerpiece of activity in a week during which Wall Street stocks are seen continuing their upward trend.</p>
<p>The computer giant, due to report on Tuesday, is a Wall Street bellwether that can impact market sentiment like other high tech heavyweights Intel Corp and Microsoft Corp.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is a very visible company, and, like Intel and Microsoft, is so widely held in portfolios that it is hard to imagine a portfolio manager who will not be watching the earnings,&quot; said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;They set the tone for the given week.  Everyone anticipates them, there is a lot of focus on them and they are certainly a market mover,&quot; he added</p>
<p>IBM is expected to report fourth quarter earnings per share of $3.88, according to First Call.  IBM reported fourth quarter 1995 net income of $3.09 per share.  </p>
<p>Strong earnings, in particular from a slew of high tech companies, have been setting the steady course for the stock market, supported by stable, albeit lackluster, bonds.</p>
<p>Intel, Ascend Communications Inc and Xilinx Inc all benefited from better than forecast earnings reports which bolstered the sector and led the overall stock market higher.</p>
<p>Microsoft Corp reported strong second quarter earnings per share of $0.57, up from $0.45 a year ago, after the close of trading Friday.  The First Call estimate was $0.51.  </p>
<p>The Microsoft results were &quot;a blowout by any standard,&quot; said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer of Value Line's Asset Management division.  The software maker's shares traded at 89 in after-hours dealings Friday on the earnings report, up from its closing quote of 87-1/8 on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>&quot;Intel, IBM and Microsoft essentially make the market,&quot; said Roy Blumberg, chief investment strategist at Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross.  &quot;Unless you have an event that will make people believe interest rates will back up sharply, institutional investors will focus on this narrow list of stocks and take averages like the Dow higher.&quot;  </p>
<p>The Dow closed Friday up 67.73 to a record 6833.10.  For the week, the Dow gained 129.31 points.</p>
<p>Blumberg said that a disappointing report from IBM &quot;would lead to a bad early day in the market, but no more than that. People will not let one number ruin the whole market.  It would hurt the Dow but not end the run.&quot;</p>
<p>Overall, analysts said they expected more of the same this week, with the stock market continuing to move higher as more earnings reports came in.  </p>
<p>&quot;It looks as though we will have another positive week because there is no reason to believe that the factors which have driven the market last week will change,&quot; Johnson said.</p>
<p>&quot;The flow of money into mutual funds has been strong and is likely to remain so, and the earning reports have been better than expected,&quot; he said, adding that through last Thursday, of the 95 companies in the S&amp;P 500 which have reported earnings, 49 have been above expectations.</p>
<p>Companies expected to report earnings this week, accompanied by their First Call estimates, include:  </p>
<p>* AT&amp;T Corp $0.79 v $0.94</p>
<p>* NYNEX Corp Q4 $0.94 vs $0.88</p>
<p>* Bell Atlantic Corp Q4 $0.97 vs $0.90</p>
<p>* Citicorp Q4 $1.95 vs $1.72</p>
<p>* Chase Manhattan Corp Q4 $1.88 vs $1.73</p>
<p>* Travelers Group Inc Q4 profit $0.13 vs loss $0.16</p>
<p>* Kellogg Co Q4 $0.77 vs $0.77</p>
<p>* Dial Corp Q4 $0.15 vs $0.24</p>
<p>* U.S. Robotics Corp Q1 $0.72 vs $0.45</p>
