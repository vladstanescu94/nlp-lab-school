<title>USA: Bay names Intel VP as chairman and CEO.</title>
<headline>Bay names Intel VP as chairman and CEO.</headline>
<dateline>SANTA CLARA, Calif. 1996-10-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bay Networks Inc said it named long-time Intel Corp executive David House as Bay's chairman, president and chief executive, replacing Paul Severino, the current chairman and acting CEO.</p>
<p>Severino will continue to serve as on the board of directors.  </p>
<p>&quot;As one of the key architects of Intel's phenomenal success, Dave House is a proven leader in the computer industry,&quot; said Severino, who cited House's &quot;30 years of big-league management experience, in-depth knowledge of the PC and enterprise marketplace, marketing skills, and close personal relationships with key executives&quot; in the industry.</p>
<p>Until recently, House was senior vice president and general manager of Intel's Enterprise Server Group, a multi-billion dollar unit, responsible for the microprocessor products used to run powerful corporate office computers.  </p>
<p>Severino stepped in only two weeks ago as acting chief executive after the resignation of Andrew Ludwick.</p>
<p>Ludwick had been chief executive of Bay Networks since the company was formed out of a merger between Wellfleet Communications Inc and Synoptics Communications Inc in 1994.</p>
<p>Ludwick had earned the ire of Wall Street for Bay's failure to keep pace with other leading network companies, like Cisco Systems Inc and 3Com Corp, which have seen explosive growth in recent years, fueled by the rise of the Internet, while's Bay's results have stagnated.  </p>
<p>In 1991, House was a senior vice president and head of Intel's Architecture, Marketing and Applications Group, managing all corporate marketing activities and overseeing the introduction of the highly regarded &quot;Intel Inside&quot; campaign.</p>
<p>He also formed the Intel Architecture Labs which continues to set advanced industry platform standards, and worked closely with major end-users on a wide variety of applications.</p>
<p>From 1992 through early 1995, as senior vice president of Corporate Strategy, House was a key architect of Intel's major strategic alliances, including the 1994 Intel/Hewlett-Packard alliance to jointly develop a 64-bit</p>
<p>House was selected following a nationwide search conducted by Heidrick &amp; Struggles, a global executive search firm specializing in chief executive and chairman assignments.</p>
