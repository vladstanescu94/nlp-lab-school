<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/3Com busy as stock slides.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-01-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Options on 3Com Corp were fairly busy at the Pacific Stock Exchange Monday as the stock fell in heavy trading.</p>
<p>Traders said investors were playing both sides -- buying puts and calls -- but the bears outnumbered the bulls.</p>
<p>By around 1355 CST/1955 GMT, 3Com shares were down 3-1/2 points at 65-1/4 on volume of more than 8.0 million shares. The stock reached a session low of 64-3/8.</p>
<p>Traders said the stock, which dropped 4-3/4 points last Friday, was down in conjunction with other high technology issues.  </p>
<p>&quot;There hasn't been any news but some other stocks in the industry group have been weak over the last few days,&quot; one trader said.  &quot;That's just speculation, though.&quot;</p>
<p>Other network stocks were mixed on Monday.  Bay Networks Inc was down 5/8 at 22-5/8 and Cisco Systems Inc was up 1/2 at 69-1/8.</p>
<p>But heavy selling continued in other high tech issues, particularly Cascade Communications Corp, which was down another 2-1/2 at 38-1/2 Monday afternoon after slumping about 23 points last Friday.</p>
<p>Turnover topped 10.5 million shares.  </p>
<p>Also, International Business Machines Corp continued its post-earnings slide, losing 3-3/8 to 147-1/8.</p>
<p>Among the 3Com options, the February 65 put was most active, with volume of about 2,175 contracts. The option, which had open interest of 4,122 contracts through last Friday, was up 1-1/4 at 3-1/2.</p>
<p>Among the regular options, the February 70 put traded 1,595 contracts and the February 70 call traded about 1,680, rounding out the most active options in the group.</p>
<p>A couple of long term put options drew sizable activity.  </p>
<p>The 3Com January 1999 45 put traded 1,930 contracts and the January 1999 55 put traded 1,100.</p>
<p>Harrison Roth, senior options strategist at Cowen &amp; Co, said it appeared the 45 puts were sold and the 55 puts were bought.</p>
<p>In other options trading, a big spread in options on ADRs of Telefonos de Mexico was seen at the Chicago Board Options Exchange.</p>
<p>The Telmex February 35 call traded 6,020 contracts and the February 35 put traded 6,000.  </p>
<p>The Telmex calls traded in four blocks, two each of 1,920 and 1,080 contracts, and went out at prices ranging from 2-9/16 to 2-5/8.  The option had open interest through last Friday of 10,764 contracts.</p>
<p>The February 35 puts traded in two blocks of 3,000 contracts at 3/8. Its open interest was 10,910.</p>
<p>Telmex shares were down 9/64 at 37 in afternoon trading Monday.</p>
