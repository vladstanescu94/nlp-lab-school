<p>Shares in Germany's high-flying software group SAP AG crashed on Wednesday, falling as much as 26 percent in early trade, after the company reported weaker third quarter growth and shaved earnings estimates.</p>
<p>SAP said pre-tax profit would rise a little over 30 percent this year, a sharp downward revision from previous forecasts, souring sentiment for the stock market darling.</p>
<p>SAP's pounding dragged down the DAX index of 30 blue-chips. Its common stock opened 18.5 percent lower and plunged 26 percent in pre-bourse trade to a low of 202 marks. The shares opened 21 percent lower at 215.50 marks in floor trade.</p>
<p>The company's preference stock, listed in the DAX index of 30 blue-chips, opened at 230 marks, down 17.2 percent from Tuesday on computerised IBIS trade. It hit a low of 210 marks, down 24 percent, and opened 21 percent lower in floor trade.</p>
<p>SAP, the world's leading manufacturer of client-server business application software, stunned markets late on Tuesday when it reported that sales and pre-tax profit in the first nine months of the year grew considerably slower than expected.</p>
<p>Profit on ordinary activities to the end of September rose 33 percent to 509 million marks ($332 million). Sales also rose 33 percent to 2.4 billion marks. Momentum slowed from 38 percent sales growth in the first half and SAP cut its 1996 sales forecast by 300 million marks to 3.5 billion marks after 2.7 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>SAP management board member Henning Kagermann set the ball rolling in a regulatory statement ahead of bourse trade which said the company would probably not achieve its target of 40 percent sales growth for the full year.</p>
<p>Management board chairman Dietmar Hopp was more specific in a telephone interview. He said the company was itself surprised by the slowdown, which came about because of particularly weak sales in September, but, he said, markets were overreacting.</p>
<p>&quot;This reaction is completely exaggerated,&quot; he said. &quot;We presume that SAP will continue to show very stable growth. Sales growth this year will be just over 30 percent and pre-tax profit will grow more than sales -- more than 30 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>SAP was the subject of much negative speculation earlier this year after publication of two reports by U.S.-based Forrester Research group that predicted global demand for the company's products would dry up next year.</p>
<p>Hopp did not seem to think the report was still affecting customer decisions in the third quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;We thought we had paid the price for this in the second quarter,&quot; he said. &quot;There were no sudden developments. Sales in September were well below June. The sales cycle appears to be getting longer and customers need more time for to decide.&quot;</p>
<p>SAP has become one of the most popular German shares in recent years because of a long streak of stellar growth and the company's emphasis on shareholder value.</p>
<p>It's main product, the R/3 client-server system is a software application that controls core logistical, sales and accounting procedures within large corporations, connecting distant branches to a company's main computer systems.</p>
<p>SAP is the world leader is what is expected to remain one of the fastest-growing markets in the technology sector, but the unexpected chink in its armour could raise doubts about the optimistic forecasts for the market as a whole.</p>
<p>&quot;That conclusion seems justifiable if you also consider developments at other companies like Oracle,&quot; said Hopp.</p>
<p>&quot;But we don't want to jump to conclusions now and say the market isn't as big as we thought. It's just that booked orders were down in the last quarter. The market is still strong.&quot;</p>
<p>Independent analysts, expecting sales to advance as much as 40 percent in the first nine months and anticipating even faster profit growth, were shocked by the slow-down.</p>
<p>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the investment banking arm of Deutsche Bank, cut SAP to &quot;neutral&quot; from &quot;overweight&quot;. It slashed its SAP earnings forecasts to 5.20 marks per share this year and 7.20 marks next year from 5.75 and 7.60 respectively.</p>
<p>Despite strong long-term growth expectations, the share price had gained recently on short-term forecasts so that the correction was not a statement of no confidence, but rather a reaction to a weaker-than-expected third quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't expect SAP to be overtaken by its competitors,&quot; said Juergen Hackenberg, analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>SAP's group workforce increased by 1,614 employees to 8,471 at the end of September. Its main competitors are Oracle Systems Corp, Baan NV and PeopleSoft.</p>
