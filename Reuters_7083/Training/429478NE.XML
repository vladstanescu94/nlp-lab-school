<headline>Netscape up on &quot;crossware&quot; road map.</headline>
<dateline>PALO ALTO, Calif. 1997-03-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares of Netscape Communications Corp jumped by nearly 12 percent after the company unveiled a &quot;road map&quot; for its next-generation products.</p>
<p>Netscape shares closed up 3-1/8 points at 29-5/8, with more than 3.7 million shares traded, making it among the 20 most active Nasdaq market shares.</p>
<p>&quot;The point of today's road map was really to show that Netscape understands and will extend the vision of what it means to be an enterprise into 21st century,&quot; said Hambrecht &amp; Quist analyst Daniel Rimer.  </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Parekh, in a research note issued this morning, also said he was reiterating his rating on the stock -- which is on the firm's recommended list -- noting Netscape shares has been trading at their lowest since the company's initial public offering in August 1995.</p>
<p>Parekh said this week's Internet World conference in Los Angeles will likely be a showcase for Netscape's upcoming Communicator 4.0 and SuiteSpot 3.0 product suites, which are due to be shipping as full products in the June quarter.  </p>
<p>Parekh said Netscape could be in its strongest-ever product position in the second half of 1997 if it can meet its technical, marketing and support challenges.</p>
<p>Parekh said in the note that he expects first quarter revenues to grow nominally from the fourth quarter of 1996, up one percent to $116.7 million, and expects growth to increase later in the year.</p>
<p>H&amp;Q's Rimer said that, despite Netscape's current product transition, he estimates revenues will be $120 million in the current first quarter, with earnings per share of $0.08, which would be up from earnings per share pf $0.06 a year ago.  </p>
<p>Earlier today, Netscape outlined its strategy to provide Internet-based software it calls &quot;crossware&quot; to companies that will use it to communicate among themselves on various projects, such as with customers and suppliers.</p>
<p>Marc Andreessen, Netscape's co-founder and senior vice president of technology, said in an interview that this market could be even larger than the market for internal corporate networks using Internet software, known as &quot;intranets&quot;.</p>
<p>Some independent research firms have said the intranet software market could grow to some $10 billion by the year 2000, only three years from now.  </p>
<p>Netscape said the company's next generation software, which would include cross-entity collaboration capabilities for what Andreessen calls &quot;extranets&quot; -- will be available in test versions later this year and delivered in 1998.</p>
<p>Rimer said the company's plans were &quot;extending the barrier between what separated Netscape as the definer of the vision (of Internet technology) and the companies who are trying to follow that vision, namely Microsoft and Lotus.&quot;</p>
<p>Shares of Microsoft, which is working on a new version of its rival Internet Explorer browser software, rose 3-1/4 to 100 and International Business Machines Corp, which owns Lotus Development Corp., gained 1-1/4 to 146. Rimer added that, despite the enthusiasm for using Internet software in corporate settings, a recent H&amp;Q survey of 50 information technology managers of Fortune 200 companies found that 71 percent expected intranet software to account for less than two percent of their annual technology budgets.</p>
<p>Rimer said this was a sign intranet software is still relatively inexpensive relative to older systems that companies must continue to maintain and he noted that most calculate nearly immediate payback from Internet technology.</p>
<p>&quot;Intranet software is very cheap,&quot; Rimer said.</p>
