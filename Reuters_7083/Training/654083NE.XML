<p>The millennium bug problem has an added complication called &quot;Assembler&quot;, which may hit many banks and financial institutions in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and to a lesser extent north America.</p>
<p>According to Software Migrations Ltd, which sells solutions to millennium bug problems, many users of COBOL software programmes also use Assembler which it says is up to three times harder to fix.</p>
<p>If the problem is not addressed by September 1, 1997, companies risk not being ready in time for midnight on December 31, 1999.</p>
<p>Some computers across the world may hit trouble when clocks tick into the next century because many programmes written in the 1970s and 1980s read only the last two digits in a given year, such as &quot;77&quot; or &quot;92&quot;. The double-zero reading for the year 2000 will cause some computers to fail or begin sending out wrong data.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, if you are a big COBOL user, chances are that some 10 per cent to 15 per cent of your software inventory actually consists of Assembler code. This may not seem much. But if that 10 per cent is three times harder to fix, then in terms of effort, the Assembler is 25 per cent of the problem,&quot; Software Migrations Ltd said in a statement at a press conference.</p>
<p>Software Migrations said banks, financial institutions, airlines and retailers used Assembler in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>Simon Grant, the firm's sales and marketing director, told Reuters urgent action was needed to tackle the problem.</p>
<p>&quot;Assembler is a minority language compared with COBOL. But its complexity means that it is becoming a significant problem which if not tackled quickly will have serious consequences for a number of very large organisations across the world,&quot; he said, adding his firm had developed a tool for the task.</p>
<p>Software Migrations quoted data from Capers Jones of SPR Research in the U.S. saying it would cost $20 billion globally to fix the problem. It added that the industry was rapidly running out of programmers to fix the problem.</p>
<p>&quot;If you haven't started prioritising by September 1, 1997 it is probably not going to get done. This is a world-wide problem with significant amounts of Assembler in Germany, France, Britain, and the U.S. There is a significant amount in Japan, also south American banks, banks in China, and South Africa,&quot; Grant said.</p>
<p>Tom Oleson, research director at high-technology consultancy IDC in Framingham, Massachusetts, agreed that some companies which had lagged behind in technology spending would have extra difficulties with Assembler.</p>
<p>&quot;Some software products do address Assembler. I don't know how successful they are but I suspect they probably are pushing product. Assembler is a different can of worms, more basic, more machine-like language than COBOL,&quot; he said.</p>
