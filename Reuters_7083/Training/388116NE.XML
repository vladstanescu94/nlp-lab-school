<title>USA: Strawberries Inc files for Chapter 11.</title>
<headline>Strawberries Inc files for Chapter 11.</headline>
<dateline>WILMINGTON, Del 1997-02-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Software distributor Strawberries Inc and its parent,  Strawberries Holding Inc, on Wednesday filed for Chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy court in Delaware.</p>
<p>In court papers the companies listed assets of $79.6 million and liabilities of $76.9 million, including $18.4 million in fixed liquidated unsecured debt, most of it trade debt, and $62.0 million in fixed liquidated secured debt.</p>
<p>The closely held secured debt is primarily senior bank debt and debt related to senior secured notes, court papers say.  </p>
<p>This is the first Chapter 11 bankruptcy to be filed in Delaware since the chief judge of the U.S. District Court last month reversed a 25 year standing order allowing the chief judge of the bankruptcy court to assign new filings. Whether the new policy will affect what has been considered a debtor- friendly jurisdiction has been a much debated subject among companies and their lawyers.</p>
<p>The Strawberries Inc petitions have been assigned to District Court Judge Roderick McKelvie.</p>
<p>Strawberries Inc is a Milford, Massachusetts based distributor of audio and visual software with operations in the six New England states, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>It is wholly owned by Strawberries Holding Inc, which is controlled by  Castle Harlan Partners II, LP, court papers say.</p>
<p>Strawberries Inc chief executive Ivan Lipton told Reuters, &quot;We've suffered a liquidity crisis brought on in the last couple of years by problems in the music industry including increased competition and weakened profit margins.&quot;</p>
<p>Lipton said the company would reorganize by closing unprofitable stores and has recently reduced the number of stores from 146 to 133.</p>
