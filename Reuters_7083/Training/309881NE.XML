<p>Hewlett-Packard Co and Cisco Systems said they plan to hold a joint briefing on Wednesday to discuss what they said would be a unique strategic alignment in the information technology industry.</p>
<p>The companies said the hour-long briefing, to be conducted by HP chairman, president and chief executive Lewis Platt and Cisco president and chief executive John Chambers, will be held at 1000 PDT (1300 EDT/1800 GMT) on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The companies said the briefing will showcase &quot;the convergence of HP's computing leadership and Cisco's Internet working expertise.&quot;</p>
<p>Officials at both companies declined to provide further details ahead of the briefing, but industry analysts and consultants said they expected the two top executives to outline longer-term collaboration between the companies.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect it to be a collaboration involving Cisco's Web server technology running on HP's high performance computers,&quot; one industry consultant said. &quot;It's not going to change the topography of the industry.&quot;</p>
<p>HP in particular has been pushing in recent weeks to build a stronger position as a supplier of Internet computing technology, drawing on its broad base of high-tech products.  </p>
<p>The Palo Alto-based computer giant has also been spelling out the road map for its next generation of high-performance computers, due to hit the market in two years and be based on 64-bit processors developed with Intel Corp.</p>
<p>Last month, for example, HP held a seminar for analysts and major customers to discuss its commitment to providing and enhancing Internet technologies for corporate customers.</p>
<p>Last week HP also announced it will collaborate with Oracle Corp on technologies to run on the new Merced processors it is developing with Intel, saying it is working with key companies throughout industry on the techonology.</p>
