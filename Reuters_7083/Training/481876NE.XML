<text>
<p>Shares of Project Software &amp; Development Inc and FileNet Corp were hammered in pre-opening trading Wednesday.</p>
<p>FileNet shares slipped 5-7/8 to 10 at their last sale, traders said, after the company said weak new orders would cut into first quarter earnings. (Corrects to delete all references to fourth quarter results.)</p>
<p>FileNet, which makes data processing systems using optical disk technology, made the announcement after the close on Tuesday. It also said it plans a restructuring.  </p>
<p>FileNet sees a $9.0 million net loss, or $0.60 a share, on revenues of $47 million for the first quarter. A year earlier it posted a net loss of $11.8 million, or $0.79 a share, including a charge, on revenues of $66.7 million.</p>
<p>A source at PaineWebber said earlier the company had been downgraded to hold from buy.</p>
<p>Project Software shares were also selling sharply lower in pre-opening trade.</p>
<p>&quot;They're getting crushed,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>The stock was off 20, knocking its value down to about 11-1/4.  </p>
<p>The company forecast earnings per share of $0.15, compared to $0.24 in the same period last year. Its software is used to maintain high-value capital assets such as plants, facilities and production equipment.</p>
<p>No earlier profit estimates were immediately available for FileNet or Project Software.</p>
