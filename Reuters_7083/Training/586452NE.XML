<p>ABC News and Starwave Corp. launched ABCNEWS.com Thursday, joining the Internet news fray with a 24-hour news service that will draw on the resources of ABC's flagship news division.</p>
<p>The service, which will be supported by advertising revenue and be available free to online computer users, also will be distributed by its partners America Online Inc. and Netscape Communications Corp.</p>
<p>ABC said ABCNEWS.com draws upon world, national and local news coverage provided by ABC News and other ABC affiliates such as ABC News Radio, NewsOne and more than 200 affiliated stations.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a medium where you can tell a story in a number of different ways,&quot; said Tom Phillips, president of ABC News Internet Ventures, at a press conference at ABC studios. &quot;This is truly news on demand. It's fresh.&quot;</p>
<p>ABC executives said that they believe their service will reach a broader audience than the existing Internet news sites of their main rivals, MSNBC and CNN. MSNBC, a joint venture between Microsoft Corp. and General Electric Corp.'s NBC, was launched last July.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they can differentiate themselves with their distribution strategy,&quot; said Jill Frankel, an analyst with IDC/Link, in New York. She said that its partnerships with America Online and Netscape bring ABC a total of about 12 million potential viewers at the onset.</p>
<p>&quot;They will have people watching their news and then they will go to the Internet for more in-depth information. Not having a cable channel is not a huge detriment,&quot; Frankel added. &quot;I was impressed by the service. There is space out there for more than two.&quot;</p>
<p>MSNBC and CNN are both cable television channels, with 24 hours of news and both cable channels promote their Web sites in their programming, which ABC also plans to do. ABC, which is a unit of Walt Disney &amp; Co., also will promote America Online in its television news programming.</p>
<p>CBS also is planning an entry in the Internet arena. A spokesman said the network will unveil its plans at its affiliate meeting later this month.</p>
<p>America Online's 8 million members will receive their own customised version of ABCNEWS.com on America Online's service, with daily &quot;slide shows&quot; featuring news audio and video-like pictures, with voice-overs by ABC news correspondents.</p>
<p>America Online members also will be able to participate in live chat sessions with ABC news personalities and newsmakers, such as Ted Koppel, Barbara Walters and others.</p>
<p>Netscape will offer ABCNEWS.com as one of its news channels in Netscape Netcaster, a component of the soon-to-be launched upgrade of its popular browser software, called Communicator. Netcaster will &quot;push&quot; requested content to the users of its Communicator client software. Communicator will be commercially available later this quarter, Netscape said.</p>
<p>ABC executives said they currently have 10 charter advertisers for the site, including Smith Barney and Mastercard International, but that they do not expect profits until the year 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;What we have said is tolerable losses between now and the year 2000 and in the black in year 2000,&quot; said Jeff Gralnick, an ABC vice president who is in charge of ABCNEWS.com.</p>
<p>ABCNEWS.com is produced by a dedicated editorial and technical team of more than 100 people, with bi-coastal news desks and production operations at ABC News in New York and Starwave in Seattle.</p>
<p>Original editorial content includes dispatches from ABC correspondents, biographies of newsmakers and in-depth analysis of the day's headline stories, business and financial market news. Real-time news is delivered via a scrolling ticker that lists breaking news headlines and top stories throughout the day. Radio news feeds from ABC News Radio are offered 24-hours a day, with reports updated continuously.</p>
<p>Starwave, ABC's joint venture partner, runs one of the most heavily trafficked Web sites on the Internet, with its ESPNet Sportszone online sports service. Starwave, which is privately held in Bellevue, Wash., was founded by Paul Allen, co-founder with Bill Gates of Microsoft Corp.</p>
