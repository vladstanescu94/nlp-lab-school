<p>Microsoft Corp.'s online Microsoft Network now has more than 2.2 million subscribers worldwide, up from 1.6 million in October, a company executive said Monday.</p>
<p>Jessica Ostrow, group product manager, said the online service plans to increase its marketing efforts as it tries to meet a goal of doubling its membership to 3.2 million this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We're continuing to move in that direction,&quot; she said in an interview. &quot;We'll see how close we come.&quot;</p>
<p>Microsoft remains a distant third-place in an industry led by America Online Inc., with 8 million subscribers, and CompuServe Corp., with 5.3 million, according to figures compiled by Electronic Information Report.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been trying to close the gap since relaunching the service based on Internet standards in October.</p>
<p>Following a television-style model, Microsoft Monday announced a &quot;spring lineup&quot; of 14 new online &quot;shows,&quot; most of which will debut Tuesday.</p>
<p>In February company executives announced plans to cancel about half the 20 shows that were launched in October.</p>
<p>Ostrow said many of the new shows, including the recently announced &quot;Disney's Daily Blast,&quot; are aimed at women and families, two fast-growing demographic groups on the Web.</p>
<p>Microsoft also is beefing up its musical offerings with several new shows including &quot;On Air,&quot; which will focus on alternative music and feature information to complement Sunday night concerts being broadcast on 120 college radio stations.</p>
<p>Other new shows include &quot;E-String,&quot; a 13-week online course in guitar-playing; &quot;(at)watercooler,&quot; a show about the workplace; &quot;Project: watchfire,&quot; a look at UFOs; and &quot;OnParenting.&quot;</p>
<p>Microsoft also has revamped the main welcome page of the service to improve access to electronic mail and other features, Ostrow said.</p>
