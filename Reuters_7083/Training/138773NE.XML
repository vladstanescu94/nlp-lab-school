<p>German software manufacturer SAP AG said on Wednesday that an unexpected decline in the rate of sales growth during the third quarter would affect its earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not very likely that that we will reach the earlier target of 40 percent pretax profit growth versus the year earlier,&quot; SAP management board member Henning Kagermann said in a regulatory statement.</p>
<p>Germany's high-flying business software group on Tuesday stunned markets with an unexpectedly sharp slowdown in growth in the third quarter that forced the company to revise full-year forecasts.</p>
<p>SAP, the world's leading maker of client-server software that controls core internal operations for companies, said profit on ordinary activities in the first nine months of 1996 rose 33 percent to 509 million marks. Sales also rose 33 percent to 2.4 billion marks.</p>
<p>But the momentum slowed significantly from the 38 percent sales growth registered in the first half of the year, causing the company to abandon its prediction that sales would rise to 3.8 billion marks in 1996 after 2.7 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The moderate growth in the third quarter means that the previous sales target is no longer achievable,&quot; said SAP chairman Dietmar Hopp. &quot;We now expect 1996 revenues to be 3.5 billion marks.&quot;</p>
<p>Independent analysts, many of whom had expected sales to advance as much as 40 percent and were anticipating even faster profit growth, were surprised by the news.</p>
<p>&quot;This is really something. Just a month and a half ago the company was touring around the country at one road show after another and gave no clue that anything was wrong,&quot; said one Frankfurt analyst, who declined to be named.</p>
<p>But analysts were reluctant to comment on the figures ahead of a telephone conference with the company scheduled for later in the evening.</p>
<p>SAP was vague on reasons for the growth slowdown.</p>
<p>&quot;The moderate growth in the third quarter was unexpected and attributable to just a few countries,&quot; Hopp said. &quot;Nevertheless we continue to see very strong demand for R/3.&quot;</p>
<p>He said SAP had expended much of its efforts recently on development and that it would now refocus on sales.</p>
<p>Revenues from software products in the first nine months rose 30 percent to 1.63 billion marks. Sales for its flagship R/3 system rose 39 percent, while sales for its mainframe R/2 system slipped 14 percent.</p>
<p>Turnover from consulting services rose 45 percent to 501 million marks and training revenue rose 26 percent to 208 million marks.</p>
<p>The United States is now the company's largest market. Sales in the first nine months there rose to 841 million marks from 596 million the year before.</p>
<p>Sales in Germany edged up to 658 million marks from 603 million, while turnover in the rest of Europe advanced to 535 million marks from 397 million. Asian sales grew to 299 million marks from 169 million and revenues in Africa rose slightly to 39 million from 25 million.</p>
<p>Paul Wahl, SAP chief executive for North America, said the company had added 70 new employees to its sales force there.</p>
<p>&quot;The market opportunities for SAP in North America remain strong and as we continue our expansion into the mid-market and new vertical industries we will continue to realise significant growth,&quot; Wahl said in the statement.</p>
<p>SAP's group workforce increased by 1,614 employees to 8,471 at the end of September.</p>
