<title>USA: Netscape international sales up in Q4.</title>
<headline>Netscape international sales up in Q4.</headline>
<dateline>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. 1997-01-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Netscape Communications Corp said international sales grew significantly in its fourth quarter to 36 percent of revenue, up sequentially from 30 percent in the third quarter.</p>
<p>The company also said it delivered more than one million servers in 1996, although it previously said this figure also includes test versions of its products.</p>
<p>Netscape's fourth quarter revenues were $115.1 million with earnings per share at $0.10, which the earnings consensus of Wall Street analysts, according to First Call. Netscape shares rose as high as 39-7/8 in after-market trading.  </p>
<p>The company's results were issued after the close of the Nasdaq market, in which Netscape shares closed at 38, up 7/8 on the session. The shares has dropped sharply in several sessions earlier this month on concern the company may have been stretched to meet its fourth quarter results targets.</p>
<p>But the company denied one analyst's remarks that it had pushed right down to the final hours of 1996 to win new business. Nevertheless, analysts have cited concerns on Wall Street over its transition to new products and a new business plan as a reason the share has fall from a 52-week high of 86.  </p>
<p>Netscape also announced the election of Eric Benhamou, chairman, president and chief executive officer of networking company 3COM Corp to its board of directors.</p>
<p>Netscape President and CEO James Barkesdale said Benhamou would bring &quot;experience and insights into industry sectors beyond our current market&quot; to the Netscape board.</p>
<p>The company's net income for the fourth quarter was $8.8 million, up from $0.05 million, or $0.01 a share, in the year- ago period. Revenues were up 177 percent from $41.6 million in the fourth quarter of 1995.  </p>
<p>For full-year 1996, Netscape's revenues rose to $346.2 million, compared with $85.4 million for 1995, while Net income for 1996 was $20.9 million, or $0.24 a share, up from a net loss of $6.6 million, or a $0.09 a share loss, in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The fourth quarter was a pivotal one for Netscape, as we underscored our focus on the enterprise market with the introduction of our next-generation client and sever software suites -- Netscape Communicator and Netscape SuiteSpot 3.0,&quot; Barkesdale said in a statement accompanying the results.</p>
<p>Netscape noted an International Data Corp study found customers using its software, including Silicon Graphics Inc could show returns of investment of more than 1,000 percent in a payback period of less than three months.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some analysts warned Netscape was unlikely to provide the upside earnings surprise in its results it had done in previous quarters.</p>
<p>Although the results were exactly in-line, the stock had sold off in recent weeks on concerns the lack of a positive earnings bounce could indicate its business is slowing as the company enters increasingly competitive markets this year.</p>
