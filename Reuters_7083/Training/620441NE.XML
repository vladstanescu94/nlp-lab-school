<headline>Novell to fire 1,000 workers, reports unexpected loss.</headline>

<p>Novell Inc., hurt by declining sales of its computer network software, Wednesday reported an unexpected loss for the latest quarter and said it plans to cut 1,000 workers in coming months.</p>
<p>The job cuts -- equal to 18 percent of the work force at Novell, the second-biggest publisher of personal computer software behind Microsoft Corp. -- would rank among the biggest ever in the computer software industry.</p>
<p>In addition, Novell said it plans to reduce inventory of unsold products by not shipping any more to distributors in the current quarter. The move will result in a third-quarter loss and substantially lower revenue.</p>
<p>Novell, based in Provo, Utah, writes computer programmes that manage the flow of information between personal computers in a network. In the past two years, the company has lost many of its customers to Microsoft and its Windows NT networking software.</p>
<p>The layoffs will help Novell cut costs, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>After the job cuts, &quot;Novell will be a more streamlined, tightly managed and responsive organisation,&quot; said Chief Executive Eric Schmidt.</p>
<p>The company will take a third-quarter charge of $25 million to $35 million to pay for the layoffs, among the biggest ever in the software industry.</p>
<p>Novell said it had a loss of $14.6 million, or 4 cents a share, in the quarter ended on April 30, compared with a loss of $55.4 million, or 15 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose to $273.1 million from $188.2 million.</p>
<p>Investors had expected Novell to report a profit of 10 cents a share, according to Zacks Investment Research, which tracks analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>Novell attributed the loss in the most recent quarter to disappointing sales of its flagship product and lower revenue from PC makers that pack its software with their machines.</p>
<p>Novell's stock was unchanged at $8.06 on Nasdaq. It reported results after most trading had ended for the day.</p>
