<headline>Earnings pessimism weighs on SAP stocks. [CORRECTED 20:20 GMT]</headline>

<p>German software company SAP AG came under pressure on the German stock exchange on Wednesday amid concern that the company's 1996 sales and earnings data, due for publication Friday, will not match its own forecasts.</p>
<p>SAP shares were the biggest decliners on the blue chip DAX index, with its preference shares ending down nine marks at 217.50 marks, while the broader market rose 0.33 percent.</p>
<p>In afternoon electronic dealings, SAP's preference shares were down 14.90 marks, or six percent, at 217 marks, while its common shares were down six percent at 213 marks.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX index was down just over one percent at 2,989.41 points.</p>
<p>&quot;We are all waiting for the (results) in suspense,&quot; said Juergen Hackenberg, a Deutsche Morgen Grenfell analyst in Frankfurt. DG Bank (corrects from Hackenberg) forecast that SAP's 1996 net income would rise to just under 500 million marks from 405 million marks in 1995.</p>
<p>That would indicate even slower growth than the 30 percent rate SAP predicted after disappointing third quarter results.</p>
<p>Hackenberg forecast net income of 537 million marks, just over the 30 percent outlook, but other analysts shared the DG Bank view. Many were revising their forecasts, saying it was unclear how SAP fared in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>(Corrects Hackenberg forecast.)</p>
<p>&quot;We already had one big disappointment from SAP, and we all still feel it in our bones,&quot; said a Frankfurt dealer.</p>
<p>SAP shares tumbled dramatically in October after the company unexpectedly cut back its earnings and sales forecasts for the year.</p>
<p>SAP, whose R/3 software is used by big companies to keep track of accounting, purchasing, manufacturing and sales data, said then it expected 1996 profit growth of 30 percent, down from an earlier forecast of 40 percent.</p>
<p>On the revised forecast, which also lowered the sales estimate eight percent to 3.5 billion marks, SAP shares tumbled almost 70 marks to about 205 marks. SAP shares have been slowly climbing back.</p>
