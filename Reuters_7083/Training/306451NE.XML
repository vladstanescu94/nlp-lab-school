<p>StarBase Corp Tuesday said that as part of an executive management realignment, Alan Davis, president and chief executive, and Robert Leimena, chief financial officer, have resigned from those positions.</p>
<p>Donald Farrow, StarBase's vice president of sales and marketing has been named president and will assume all responsibilities for the day-to-day operations of the provider of integrated team software configuration management (SCM) tools.  </p>
<p>Company officials were not available for comment.</p>
<p>StarBase said William Stow III will remain as chairman of the board and Davis and Leimena will serve as consultants to the company.</p>
<p>The company also said Roger Ferguson, Gary Gratny and Michael Lyones have resigned from its board of directors. Daniel Ginns, chairman and CEO of Datametrics Corp in Woodland Hills, Calif., has joined StarBase board.</p>
<p>Stow said, &quot;Al Davis and Robert Leimena joined StarBase about a year ago when the company was making a difficult transition from a purely development organization to a fully functional technology company. Al and Robert were responsible for bringing in a new management team to take the company to the next level. This has now occurred.  Al and Robert have put in place the infrastructure, organization and methodologies that allow the company to focus on providing our customers with innovative products and outstanding service.&quot;</p>
<p>Davis said, &quot;We are pleased to have been able to assist StarBase during this transitional period. Now that this transition is successfully completed, it is time for the company to move forward with this realignment of the management team and board of directors.&quot;</p>
