<p>SAS Institute, a private U.S.-based software company, on Friday announced the launch of its Bombay liaison office and said it was targeting the Indian financial, telcommunications and manufacturing sectors.</p>
<p>&quot;Our vision is quite long term in India,&quot; Rohini Midha, SAS's India country manager said at a news conference in Bombay.</p>
<p>SAS, which currently counts revenues of about $150,000-200,000 per year from Indian customers, hopes its earning power in India will take off in the next few years, Midha said.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to increase our revenue at least five-fold in the next three years,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>SAS will target the top 100 Indian companies, Midha added.</p>
<p>SAS Institute, based in North Carolina, is among the top global companies in end-to-end solutions for data warehousing and data mining. SAS software includes capabilities and tools for data warehousing including managing, organising and exploiting the warehouse.</p>
<p>&quot;By partnering with Indian consultants, we will provide Indian companies with the ability to make better business decisions based upon data, rather than guess-work,&quot; Midha said.</p>
<p>The firm has over 55 Indian customers which include the Reserve Bank of India, BPL Ltd., Tata Iron &amp; Steel Company and Standard Chartered Bank who are served through Tata Consultancy Services, SAS's Indian distributor since 1991.</p>
<p>SAS software is being used at 30,000 business, government and university sites in the world.</p>
<p>&quot;The office has been opened to provide better support to our current Indian customers and further address the marketing and sales needs of the Indian market,&quot; said Lee Richardson, SAS's director of Asia Pacific operations.</p>
<p>SAS Institute earned worldwide revenues of $653 million in 1996, officials said. The firm has a direct presence in 39 countries and is represented in 16 other countries through distributor alliances, they said.</p>
