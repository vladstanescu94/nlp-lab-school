<headline>IPO HIGHLIGHTS- Peritus rockets 70 pct.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares of Peritus Software Services Inc surged nearly 70 percent after their initial public offering.</p>
<p>The stock was the top gainer on the Nasdaq on a percent basis. It jumped to 27 from an IPO price of $16, which was above its price range of $12 to $14.</p>
<p>Montgomery led the offering of 3.5 million shares with 2.8 million sold by the company and the remainder by selling shareholders.  Terms of the IPO were ratcheted up from an initial estimate of a sale of 2.9 million share between $10 and $12 each.  </p>
<p>Peritus is the hottest IPO this week, analysts have said.</p>
<p>The Billerica, Mass., company develops software to deal with large-scale changes that can trip up other software.  One program addresses the mayhem that could erupt in the changeover to the year 2000.  Peritus is also developing programs' to deal with the European Union's expected conversion to a single currency and when Japan changes over all its phone numbers to expand to more digits.</p>
<p>But the high-technology company does not come without risks.  It was founded only about six years ago and incurred a net loss of $4.9 million in 1996.  </p>
<p>Other companies that made their IPO debuts:</p>
<p>-- Lamalie Associates Inc shares also jumped, to 16-1/8 from an IPO price of $12, the high end of a $10 to $12 range.  Lamalie is the fifth largest U.S. executive search firm, according to its prospectus.  It gets a flat fee every time it places a new top executive and an additional fee of about one-third of the new employee's annual cash salary.</p>
<p>On average, its executives get paid $226,000 for their first year.  Its compound annual growth rate is about 30 percent, compared with 21 percent for its competitors.</p>
