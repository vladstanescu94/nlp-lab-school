<title>USA: MetaTools, Fractal to merge.</title>
<headline>MetaTools, Fractal to merge.</headline>
<dateline>CARPINTERIA, Calif. 1997-02-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>MetaTools Inc and Fractal Design Corp on Tuesday said they agreed to merge in a deal worth about $145 million.</p>
<p>The companies said in a statement that each Fractal stockholder would receive 0.749 share of MetaTools common stock for each Fractal share owned. Fractal had about 12.9 million shares outstanding at the end of December.</p>
<p>The merger will be non-dilutive to 1997 combined earnings, excluding costs related to the merger, the companies said.  </p>
<p>MetaTools expects shares used to calculate fully diluted earnings per share will increase by about 9.8 million as a result of common stock and options issued in the merger.</p>
<p>Certain affiliates of both MetaTools and Fractal Design have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the merger.</p>
<p>In addition, MetaTools and Fractal Design have granted each other an option to purchase newly issued shares equal to 19.9 percent of the outstanding stock of each company, when the options become exercisable.  </p>
<p>Shares in Fractal rose 3/8 to 8-1/8 in Nasdaq trading on Tuesday, while MetaTools stock was unchanged at 15.</p>
<p>The deal was unanimously approved by the board of directors of both companies. The merger will be accounted for as a pooling of interests structured to qualify as a tax-free reorganization.</p>
<p>The deal is contingent on shareholders approval and other customary closing conditions. It is expected to close in the quarter ending June 30.</p>
<p>The merged company -- with combined calendar 1996 revenues of $65.2 million -- would offer products and technologies for visual computing markets, including consumer and professional photography and video, digital imaging, animation, computer graphics, three-dimensional and data visualization.</p>
<p>&quot;The combination of MetaTools and Fractal Design accelerates our drive to be the global leader in visual computing software,&quot; said John Wilczak, chief executive of MetaTools.</p>
<p>Wilczak will serve as chief executive of the combined company. Mark Zimmer, Fractal's chief executive, will become chief technical officer, and Tom Hedges, Fractal's chairman, will become chief systems architect.</p>
