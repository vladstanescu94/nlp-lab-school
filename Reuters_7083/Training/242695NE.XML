<p>High technology stocks led the broad market's comeback from last week's decline and options on some of the group's leaders drew heavy buying, particularly on the call side, traders said Monday.</p>
<p>Stock splits on Microsoft Corp and Dell Computer Co, which took effect Monday, helped push things along, they said.</p>
<p>Seven of the 10 most active calls on the Pacific Stock Exchange were Microsoft options, led by the December 77-1/2, which traded 4,925 contracts by 1445 CST/2045 GMT.  </p>
<p>Micrsoft shares were up 4-1/8 at 80-1/2. The stock split two for one after Friday's 152-7/8 close.</p>
<p>Other busy Microsoft calls included the December 80, the December 75 and the January 80. The most active put was the December 75, which traded more than 1,400 contracts.</p>
<p>&quot;It was off two points on Friday but came back up so a lot of people were looking at calls,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 41 points intraday Friday but closed down only 12.</p>
<p>By late trading Monday it was up nearly 29 points, or 2.2 percent, at 1,316.  </p>
<p>The trader said a stock split in Dell Computer also led to some fresh options interest.</p>
<p>Among the Dell options, which trade on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the December 55 call traded more than 1,400 contracts, the December 40 call about 430 and the January 57-1/2 more than 700.</p>
<p>Dell shares, which avoided Friday's decline, rose 3-3/4 to 60-1/2 Monday. The stock closed at 113-1/2 Friday.</p>
<p>Both the Microsoft and Dell split were in the form of dividends.  </p>
<p>On the American Stock Exchange, Intel Corp options were among the most active, with the December 130 call trading more than 6,000 contracts. The December 125 call traded about 2,325 and the December 140 call traded 1,620.</p>
<p>The January 130 and 135 calls were also active.</p>
<p>Intel shares gained 4-7/16 to 130-1/8.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, traders said Philip Morris Cos Inc options were heavily traded but the action was just a dividend capture play. The stock goes ex-dividend December 12.</p>
