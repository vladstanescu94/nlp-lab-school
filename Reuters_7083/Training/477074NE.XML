<title>USA: Disney Online launches subscriber service.</title>
<headline>Disney Online launches subscriber service.</headline>
<dateline>NORTH HOLLYWOOD, Calif. 1997-03-31</dateline>

<p>The Walt Disney Co.'s Internet division, Disney Online, on Monday unveiled a long-awaited subscriber-based Internet service aimed at what it calls the &quot;Internet Generation&quot; of children aged three to 12.</p>
<p>As part of the launch, Microsoft Corp.'s Microsoft Network holds the exclusive right to provide the service, called Disney's Daily Blast, to its subscribers for 10 months.</p>
<p>Disney's newest online site, which features comics, games and youth-oriented news, will cost subscribers $4.95 a month and be widely available at the end of April. MSN subscribers will receive it at no extra charge with their subscription.</p>
<p>&quot;The package is designed to be part of the family's daily ritual,&quot; Jake Winebaum, president of Disney Online, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The service will target what he called a vast number of families who own computers but do not use the Internet because they are concerned about the lack of content for kids, he said.</p>
<p>The service will freshen pages every day with new information in order to keep children involved. During download times, the service has built in gimmicks with animated characters to keep eyes glued to the screen. Some of the pages, such as the daily jokes, allow children to offer feedback so Disney Online's writers and designers can change them easily and quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;The kids are going to shape this medium,&quot; said Winebaum.</p>
<p>A bowling game will post scores so that children can compare their scores with others' and the top scores will be updated daily on an ESPN page. Sports pages will include scores of college and professional games, and profiles of star athletes.</p>
<p>Disney's ABC News division will contribute top news stories oriented toward children and designed in such a way to explain complicated issues of the stories.</p>
<p>For instance, a story about the recent suicides of 39 cult members in San Diego might also include an explanation of what cults are, why they exist and how they operate.</p>
<p>Winebaum joined Disney in August 1995 to launch Disney on the Internet. Since then, Disney has launched two sites, Disney.com, with information about movies, television shows and merchandise, and Family.com, with information for the family.</p>
<p>One of Winebaum's goals since joining has been to launch an entertaining subscription service by the spring of this year.</p>
<p>Disney.com has proved to be a highly visited site on the Net, logging over 300,000 users and averaging nearly 7.0 million &quot;hits&quot; per day, Winebaum said. A hit is one instance a user comes onto a site or moves from page to page in a site.</p>
<p>Winebaum declined to give a target number of users the company expects to subscribe, but said Disney Online has built the infrastructure to match its experience with Disney.Com.</p>
<p>Also, by launching a subscriber-based service, instead of a free service, and by delivering it through MSN, which has 1.5 million subscribers, Disney is able to estimate more accurately the number of users who will sign on at the launch.</p>
<p>Disney plans to open the site for two weeks on April 9 to 10,000 users who will be selected through a special &quot;Digital Drawing&quot; on the Web. After that, the site will be open to any user who pays the subscription fee.</p>
