<p>German software developer SAP AG on Friday said foreign sales and a robust fourth quarter lifted 1996 profit by 40 percent, surprising analysts and beating its own autumn forecast.</p>
<p>Profit rose to 67 million marks ($347 million) and sales rose 38 percent to 3.72 billion marks, boosted by a 57 percent rise in international revenue and a fourth quarter that saw sales climb 49 percent to 1.35 billion marks.</p>
<p>SAP sales could rise another 25 to 30 percent in 1997, but &quot;a continuation of the strong growth in the fourth quarter would be too much to hope for,&quot; CEO Dietmar Hopp told Reuters.</p>
<p>Over the next two to three years, SAP expected to outpace the growth of the business management software market, where sales have boomed as companies increase use of the Internet and &quot;client/server&quot; computer systems, Hopp said.</p>
<p>He also said SAP aimed to keep profit rising next year by keeping cost increases below the rate of sales growth.</p>
<p>1996 pretax profit rose 43 percent to 996 million marks, while earnings per share increased 37 percent to 5.48 marks.</p>
<p>Shares in SAP, which joined Germany's blue chip DAX index last year, soared on the earnings surprise to a high of 252 marks, before settling back to 240 in midday floor trading, still up 24 marks on the day.</p>
<p>SAP stock had slumped earlier in the week as analysts braced for a repeat of SAP's third-quarter earnings report in October. The shares fell almost 70 marks when SAP said 1996 sales would reach only 3.5 billion marks and profit would rise only 30 percent because of a weak third quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure they did everything they could in the fourth quarter to increase results. The results were clearly better than SAP thoguht they would be,&quot; said Vereinsbank Research analyst Peter Thilo Hasler, who on Wednesday lowered his rating on SAP to &quot;below average&quot; from &quot;market neutral.&quot;</p>
<p>Hasler said he would maintain the below average rating on concerns about rising costs and headcount. SAP had 9,196 employees at the end of 1996, up 34 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p>But DG Bank's Heinz Weyerhauser reacted to the SAP earnings report by raising his rating to &quot;buy&quot; from &quot;hold&quot; and upping his 1997 earnings estimate to 7.40 marks per share from 6.10 marks per share.</p>
<p>Analysts said SAP also gained from the dollar's recent rise because of its strong sales in the United States.</p>
<p>American sales in 1996 rose 47 percent to 1.35 billion marks, while Asian sales increased 67 percent to 486 million marks. European sales climbed 27 percent to 1.81 billion marks.</p>
<p>Sales of SAP's star R/3 software, which companies use to track accounting, purchasing, production and personnel data, increased 44 percent to 2.37 billion marks.</p>
<p>SAP added 1,089 R/3 customers in 1996, bringing the number of worldwide installations to more than 9,000.</p>
<p>New R/3 versions with modifications for European currency union and adjustments for the turn of the century &quot;have increased interest in our products worldwide,&quot; Hopp said.</p>
<p>R/3 Version 3.1, which allows companies to handle sales transactions over the Internet, began shipping in December and also brought in new orders, Hopp said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, SAP formed units to expand the customer base by selling R/3 to mid-sized companies in specific industries such as health care, government and finance. Before SAP had focused mostly on sales to large corporations.</p>
<p>For the year, consulting and training revenue grew 43 percent to 1.04 billion marks.</p>
