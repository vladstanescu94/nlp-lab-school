<title>USA: Chevron shifts from Netscape browser to IE.</title>
<headline>Chevron shifts from Netscape browser to IE.</headline>
<dateline>SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. 1997-03-25</dateline>

<p>Tech-savvy oil giant Chevron Corp., one of the earliest companies to embrace Netscape Communications Corp.'s Netscape Navigator browser, said Tuesday it has decided to gradually shift to Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Explorer instead.</p>
<p>Although the decision will not be materially significant for either company -- Microsoft gives away its Web browser and Netscape's volume discounts for major corporations reduce the cost to a few dollars each -- the move is seen as a blow to Netscape coming from a well-regarded early adapter.</p>
<p>Jim Moen, an official at the oil company's Chevron Information Technology Corp. (CITC) in San Ramone, Calif., said Chevron's decision was based on five major criteria -- the cost of running and supporting the software, strategic decisions, user satisfaction, business value to Chevron and future product directions.</p>
<p>Microsoft did not win in all categories, but was helped by Chevron's strategic commitment to the Microsoft Windows platform and Office, in addition to ownership costs, he said.</p>
<p>Jim Nathlich, a technical analyst at CITC, said the company has some 30,000 desktop computers.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as a purchasing decision, it's really a moot point,&quot; he said. &quot;Most of the machines we get today have both. Basically, those products are free.&quot;</p>
<p>The Chevron officials said the decision had actually been taken by a guidance review group a few months ago, and would be implemented gradually over a one-year period.</p>
<p>Chevron officials said Netscape browsers will still be used on its Unix computers and on its firewall, software which protects an internal network from hackers, at the moment.</p>
<p>Income from Navigator, whose retail price tag is due to go up to $59 in April, still provided a majority of Netscape's revenue in the fourth quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Netscape executives were not immediately available for comment. Netscape shares closed up 3-7/16 at 32-3/4 Tuesday in Nasdaq trading.</p>
