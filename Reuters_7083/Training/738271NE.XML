<title>USA: RESEARCH ALERT - Synopsys downgraded.</title>

<p>Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co downgraded Synopsys to a Long Term Attractive from a Buy rating and lowered FY97 EPS estimate from $1.55 to $1.52, and FY98 EPS estimate from $1.98 to $1.93.</p>
<p>Analyst Jennifer Smith said while Q397 EPS met her estimates and revenue was in line with expectations, she is concerned about future revenue growth.</p>
<p>&quot;The real issue is slowing synthesis growth, that is not easily compensated for from other product areas.  We believe Synopsys is working through several product transition issues now that synthesis growth has been slowing.  Synopsys has introduced new products in the area of timing and power analysis, but these products are sold for significantly less than synthesis, and cannot adequately offset a slowdown in synthesis,&quot; said Smith.</p>
<p>However, Smith believes that the EDA industry overall will have improved growth in 2H:97, and Synopsys guidance towards lower growth is counter to this trend.</p>
<p>As a result, Robertson Stephens believes many of Synopsys' issues are internal, as the company focuses on where to derive future growth. While the industry in general encountered slower growth in calendar Q197, Robertson Stephens is seeing initial recovery in some companies this quarter, with a likelihood of accelerated revenue into the last half of 1998.</p>
