<p>A computer piracy watchdog backed by top U.S. software companies said on Wednesday it hoped to bring its first private legal claim against a Saudi company within two months for alleged copyright violations.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't brought a private claim yet, but we hope to in the next two months,&quot; said Brian McEachron, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based Business Software Alliance (BSA).</p>
<p>&quot;The claim will be brought by the BSA on behalf of the individual companies that make up the BSA,&quot; McEachron told Reuters on a visit to Dubai.</p>
<p>The BSA -- which groups software heavyweights like Microsoft, Novell Inc and Lotus, part of International Business Machines Corp -- estimates that nine out of 10 software programmes used in Saudi Arabia are unlicensed.</p>
<p>By comparison, piracy rates in western Europe hover between 30 and 50 percent, the BSA said.</p>
<p>&quot;The rate of piracy in Saudi Arabia is quite high in global terms,&quot; said McEachron, who is also senior corporate attorney at Microsoft. He said losses in the kingdom were about $100 million in 1995, the largest single shortfall in the Middle East.</p>
<p>&quot;In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia is the big problem,&quot; he said, adding that copyright enforcement was still weak.</p>
<p>The BSA says some 115,000 personal computers were sold in Saudi Arabia in 1995. PC sales are used to gauge the software market.</p>
<p>McEachron said lax or lacking copyright laws in the Gulf made the region a piracy trouble spot. &quot;In 1994 it was the only region where average piracy rates went up, not down,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>McEachron said that while the United Arab Emirates had made great strides in fighting software piracy, the other Gulf Arab countries had a long way to go.</p>
<p>Piracy in the UAE had decreased to 80 percent from 90 in 1994, with losses of about $30-40 million annually, he said.</p>
<p>The UAE introduced copyright laws in 1992 as part of a bid to make the Gulf state more attractive to foreign investors.</p>
<p>Authorities have stepped up efforts to enforce the law, and have regularly raided shops and companies suspected of selling pirated goods, a widespread practice in the oil-rich Gulf.</p>
<p>In October, the Dubai public prosecutor pressed charges against a computer shop's manager and his sponsor for selling pirated software, the first such prosecution in the UAE.</p>
