<p>China said on Wednesday it had fined a Japanese-funded company 500,000 yuan ($60,200) for producing computer wargames featuring World War Two battles.</p>
<p>The computer games, produced by the Tianjin Koei Co, had &quot;hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and distorted the Japanese invasion of China&quot; in the 1930s, state radio said.</p>
<p>The games sold on computer disks had been produced in the northern city of Tianjin without authorisation by local press and publication authorities, state radio said.</p>
<p>&quot;War criminals who were responsible for the death of many Chinese people were characterised as generals in the software programme, which is unacceptable to us,&quot; the official media had said earlier this year.</p>
<p>The company's operations were halted between July and September as the incident was investigated.</p>
<p>About 35 million Chinese were killed or wounded during Japan's invasion and occupation of China in the 1930s and 1940s.</p>
<p>State radio said that all of the software games -- called &quot;Governor's Decision&quot; -- had been confiscated and destroyed and the company had promised not to repeat its mistake in future.</p>
<p>Four employees who had informed on the company were publicly honoured, it said.</p>
