<p>Shares of Apple Computer Inc. continued to soar Thursday, reaching the highest level in 18 months amid optimism that the $150 million investment from Microsoft Corp. and a new board of directors will bolster the fortunes of the computer maker.</p>
<p>Apple stock was up $3, or 11 percent, at $29.313 in midday trading on Nasdaq. Earlier, the stock traded as high as $30, the highest since March 1996. In the past month, the stock has more than doubled from $13.</p>
<p>Trading was brisk with volume of 24.5 million shares.</p>
<p>On Wednesday Microsoft agreed to invest $150 million in one-time mortal enemy Apple, promised to continue to write business software for the Macintosh and agreed to share its technology with Apple.</p>
<p>Apple also revealed that it had revamped its board of directors. It named four computer industry heavyweights, including Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison, Intuit Inc. President Bill Campell, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and former International Business Machines Corp. finance chief Jerome York.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you think of better news? This is very good for Apple,&quot; said Daniel Kunstler, analyst at JP Morgan Securities in San Francisco. Kunstler Thursday lifted Apple's stock rating to &quot;long-term buy&quot; from &quot;market performer.&quot;</p>
<p>Added David Wu, analyst at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp.: &quot;Yesterday, I would have said Apple doesn't have a future. Today I say it does.&quot;</p>
<p>The new board members bring lots of financial and marketing experience, something shareholders had criticised the previous board for not having, analysts said. The new all-star board also could make it easier for Apple to find a new chief executive.</p>
<p>The Cupertino, Calif., company has been without a CEO and chairman since Gilbert Amelio was ousted a month ago.</p>
