<headline>Oracle says Apple's future in network computers.</headline>

<p>The president of Oracle Corp said Tuesday that Apple Computer Inc has missed the chance to prosper in the personal computer boom and its best hope now rests with low-cost network computers.</p>
<p>&quot;They may find a new light in network computers, and education markets they're still strong in, but in PCs, it's over. It's a monopoly,&quot; Oracle president Raymond Lane told Reuters at a conference on corporate alliances. He was referring to Microsoft Corp's grip on the industry.  </p>
<p>Lane's comments came as Oracle chief executive officer Larry Ellison is considering making a personal bid for the Cupertino, Calif., computer company.</p>
<p>Ellison, who has expressed interest in Apple previously, last month began soliciting investor reaction to a potential acquisition. He has said any bid for Apple would be independent of Oracle.</p>
<p>&quot;If Larry invests in Apple, if he got control of Apple, we think Apple would be building NCs,&quot; Lane said.</p>
<p>Ellison also has been touting Apple as a potential supplier of the stripped-down network computers.  </p>
<p>Lane declined to discuss the chances of a bid by Ellison, saying &quot;this is very complex. You can't predict the outcome.&quot; He noted Ellison is sailing in Antigua this week.</p>
<p>Apple could not be reached for comment on Lane's remarks.</p>
<p>Apple recently mounted an advertising campaign aimed at raising its profile after widespread publicity about its financial problems and loss of market share.  </p>
<p>At the Conference Board conference sponsored by consulting firm Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, Lane said Apple had estranged itself from the rest of the computer industry by not participating in far-reaching alliances.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that Apple has &quot;a pretty cool computer,&quot; Lane said the company did not understand the importance of partnering with competitors and sharing technology. He specifically compared Apple's decision to keep its operating system as proprietary technology with the strategy used by Microsoft which made its operating system widely available.  </p>
<p>Companies that developed computer applications &quot;liked Apple, but they only had one choice - Microsoft,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lane also touted Oracle's corporate strategy, frequently using the buzzword &quot;co-opetition&quot; - a combination of &quot;cooperation&quot; and &quot;competition&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;In most cases, it's not a choice,&quot; he said of the need for intensive partnerships to ensure a company's long term viability.</p>
