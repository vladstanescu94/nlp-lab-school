<p>VLSI Technology Inc on Thursday said its chip for securing data distributed over networks has been selected as a core technology in personal computers being designed specifically for entertainment and electronic commerce.</p>
<p>The PCs are to be developed through an industrywide initiative launched by Microsoft Corp. VLSI officials said the company's soon-to-be-released GhostRider chip will perform security functions in the equipment under development.  </p>
<p>Earlier Microsoft announced an effort involving three dozen companies to develop a personal computer that combines television, Internet and PC technologies. Microsoft and VSLI said they hoped the PCs would become available in retail outlets by late this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We want this market to jump quickly, but it depends on how quickly consumers adapt,&quot; Umesh Padval, vice president of VSLI's computing solutions group, told Reuters.  </p>
<p>&quot;We developed the chip and are working with Microsoft and some of the PC and add-in card makers to get it integrated into their systems,&quot; said Padval. &quot;We will supply hardware security to the systems providers.&quot;</p>
<p>Neil Shea, VLSI's director of its secure products group, said the GhostRider -- to be formally introduced this month -- is one of two chips for handling security that the company plans to bring to market this year. The second is for controlling distribution of digital entertainment.</p>
<p>Microsoft last year launched its &quot;Simply Interactive PC&quot; initiative to create a set of technologies consisting of broadcast components that would allow PCs to receive television programming, data services and new forms of entertainment that blend the two.</p>
<p>This week Microsoft renewed that effort by announcing partners and a set of new user interface elements for its Windows operating system that would allow for the new PCs.</p>
<p>Systems manufacturers participating in Microsoft's intitiative include Compaq Computer Corp, Gateway 2000 Inc, Hitachi Ltd, Fujitsu Ltd and Sony Electronics Inc.</p>
