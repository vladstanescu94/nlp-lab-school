<title>USA: U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Oracle, Cisco are bright spots.</title>
<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Oracle, Cisco are bright spots.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-03-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>Two bright spots in the broad market swoon Thursday were Oracle Corp and Cisco Systems Inc, which both posted solid gains accompanied by heavy options activity.</p>
<p>In late trading, Oracle was up 2-1/8 at 36-1/4 on nearly 13 million shares and Cisco gained 1-1/8 to 52 on 12.1 million shares.</p>
<p>The broader Nasdaq composite index was down 11.80 points, or 0.9 percent, at 1,292.</p>
<p>But the big loser was the Dow industrial average, which was off 160 points, or about 2.3 percent, at 6,879.  </p>
<p>Oracle was scheduled to report quarterly earnings after the close, but traders said the options activity was strong both ways, offering little insight into what investors were expecting.</p>
<p>But volatility in Oracle March options was &quot;sky high,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of action in the (March) 35 puts and calls,&quot; he said, adding that both buyers and sellers were active.  </p>
<p>The Oracle March 35 call traded 1,760 contracts and the March 35 put traded about 3,850. The March 40 call also was busy, with turnover of 2,375. The March 40 put traded 3,205 contracts.</p>
<p>The trader said investors were focused on the March contracts because of the earnings report and a possible reaction in the stock Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;They're using the March (options) as cheap protection&quot; instead of rolling out to April.</p>
<p>March options expire at the end of next week.  </p>
<p>Investors in Cisco options were getting out of March positions but not necessarily rolling them into April.</p>
<p>&quot;In Cisco a lot of people were selling the March 50 and March 55 puts,&quot; Patrick Hamilton at LETCO said. &quot;People are starting to get out of positions.&quot;</p>
<p>The March 50 put traded more than 5,800 contracts and the March 55 put traded about 2,400.</p>
<p>&quot;They haven't been rolling into April much,&quot; Hamilton said, adding that he had several requests for the March/April time spread but few trades.</p>
<p>Investors were buying the April 45 and 50 calls, he said.  </p>
<p>The Cisco April 45 call traded about 625 contracts and the April 50 call traded 810. The April 55 call traded nearly 2,240 contracts.</p>
<p>Volatility in Cisco options declined on the stock's rally, Hamilton said.</p>
