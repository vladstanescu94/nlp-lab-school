<p>The next version of Oracle Corp.'s database software, Oracle 8, is &quot;on track&quot; to be launched worldwide on June 24, Oracle President Ray Lane said Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll combine it with network computing, but it's going to ship on time,&quot; he said after making a keynote speech at a UK US Partners in Technology conference here.</p>
<p>Oracle 8 is a revamped version of the company's flagship product which is designed to handle much more information. Investors have been anticipating its release because it should enable the company to attract new customers.</p>
<p>Lane said the announcement will also include further details on the company's Network Computer initiative under which partners are making low-cost devices that can draw their power from vast computer networks.</p>
<p>Oracle has been leading the charge to expand network-based computing, which also provides opportunities for it to increase sales of its database software products.</p>
<p>Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison has also trumpeted Network Computers as a way to challenge Microsoft Corp., which together with Intel Corp., are dominant players in the personal computer market.</p>
