<p>The new security protocol for safeguarding credit-card transactions on the Internet may have to be changed because the underlying cryptography is too easy to decode and too difficult to upgrade, an expert said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Steve Mott, senior vice president of electronic commerce and new ventures for MasterCard International, said it could take hackers as little as a year to break the industry's standard encryption code, which is supposed to render credit-card numbers unreadable to outsiders on the Internet's World Wide Web.  </p>
<p>For that reason, the consortium of technology companies and creditors that has spent two years years developing the Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) protocol may switch to a faster encryption system called Elliptic Curve, which is produced by  Certicom Corp.</p>
<p>The first complete version of SET, known as SET 1.0, will be available to software makers June 1 with core cryptography provided by RSA Data Security, a unit of Security Dynamics Technologies Inc.  </p>
<p>&quot;RSA is a very good starting point. But we suspect that in a year or two, the Kevin Mitnicks of the world will start to figure out ways to hack it,&quot; Mott said, referring to Mitnick, a notorious computer hacker.</p>
<p>&quot;The only way you scale an RSA is to add a lot more bits. You add a lot more bits and it becomes more complex software in terms of the interaction of the transaction messages. That's part of what's taken SET so long to start with,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>MasterCard has been helping to bring together merchants with its member banks for SET pilot projects in Denmark, Japan, Taiwan, South Africa and the United States.</p>
<p>Mott told a news conference at the Internet Commerce Expo that the Elliptic Curve system would make a better encryption core. In fact, he said it would have been chosen in the first place if developers had been known about it.</p>
<p>&quot;It will fit on a chip card. I think its 160 bits equals security to 1,024 bits of RSA,&quot; the credit industry executive said. &quot;We anticipate putting it into some SET 1.0 pilots in the very near future this year in the U.S.&quot;</p>
<p>Far from being disturbed by the possibility of hackers getting through the current SET cryptography, Mott said SET's developers would &quot;give them an award and a ribbon and then embody whatever they did as part of the improvements&quot; in the next version of security standards.</p>
<p>&quot;The current version for SET is as safe as anybody can make it,&quot; he said.</p>
