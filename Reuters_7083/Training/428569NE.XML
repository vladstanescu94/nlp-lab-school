<headline>Sybase to unveil new products on April 7.</headline>

<p>Sybase Inc plans a major announcement on April 7 to unveil products that are expected to drive the company's revenues in the second half of 1997, Chief Executive Mitchell Kertzman said on Friday.</p>
<p>Kertzman, who was chief executive of Powersoft until its 1995 merger with Sybase, said the products were aimed at bringing Sybase back into a leadership position in the database market. Kertzman joined Sybase last year.</p>
<p>He was speaking during a panel discussion at a Hambrecht &amp; Quist investment conference in San Francisco.  </p>
<p>The chief executive said the company's management has been &quot;internally focused&quot; on its turnaround efforts, but that would begin to change after Sybase's April 7 product announcement in Orlando, Florida.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very hard to pole-vault out of a hole in the ground,&quot; Kertzman said, referring to the difficulties of turning around the company.</p>
<p>Sybase's new product initiatives have targeted areas necessary for Web application development, including the NetImpact Studio suite from Powersoft and a Web server known as Net Impact Dynamo.</p>
<p>The company's next database offering, SQL Server 11.1, is expected to add major technical and performance features, according to H&amp;Q analysts. ((sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400))</p>
