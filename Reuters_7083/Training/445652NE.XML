<p>The drink dispenser was automatic but two well-dressed women stood on either side of the machine, pointing at the cups and smiling politely whenever someone came up to help themselves to tea.</p>
<p>A large Japanese company had employed a group of young women to help manage an exhibition of current and future high-technology products. But the sight of them employed in such an ornamental fashion seemed to underscore a growing complaint from Japanese women that they do not play a very meaningful role in Japanese working life.</p>
<p>The problem may be more graphically illustrated with how women use, or do not use, the Internet. The Internet may be taking the world by storm but in Japan women are on the periphery when it comes to cyberspace.</p>
<p>Market research firm International Data Corp. estimated there are 6.7 million users of the Internet in Japan, a figure expected to nearly double by 1998. But women account for just 10 percent of users, much lower than the 40 percent estimated for a country such as the United States.</p>
<p>In fact Forrester Research has forecast that by the year 2000, some 18 million women will be on the Internet worldwide, up from about 5 million now. But it is unclear how women in Japan will take part.</p>
<p>The Internet is still in its infancy in Japan, with some Japanese players estimating it is at least three years behind countries such as the United States and Canada. If Japan follows the North American pattern, men would be the first Web surfers and women will follow closely behind.</p>
<p>But it remains far from clear whether the women will follow in Japan. There have been concerted efforts to attract more women to the Net, largely because of the marketing potential of attracting such an important and affluent segment of the Japanese marketplace.</p>
<p>A few companies have set up Internet services that allow only female subscribers, a concept that might be difficult to follow in the West because of anti-discrimination laws.</p>
<p>Aya Ishihara, who manages the Calen Internet service for women for SSK &amp; RCY Corp., agreed such an idea might not work outside of Japan and even admitted it was not natural to draw a line between the sexes.</p>
<p>But she said women often found the Internet aimed more at men and many of her customers would welcome a service tailored for them.</p>
<p>&quot;Women would like to the join the Internet but they tend to be reluctant because the Internet caters to men,&quot; she said through an interpreter.</p>
<p>There have been complaints that women find the Net difficult to understand in Japan and that sometimes they get harassed by male surfers through e-mail and the like.</p>
<p>It is believed Japanese women who do use the Internet do it from the office during lunch hour as surfing is still expensive in Japan, largely because the country does not have flat rates for local calls used to access the computer network.</p>
<p>Masahiro Inoue, president of Yahoo Japan, said his company wanted to offer services catering to Japanese &quot;office ladies&quot; -- a term used for women who perform a variety of functions in Japan's large corporations -- by offering special areas of interest for them.</p>
<p>In North America, a growing number of sites are geared toward women and encourage networking between female Internet surfers.</p>
<p>Microsoft Corp., for instance, has introduced Under Wire magazine as part of its MSN Premium Service. The magazine is currently promoting &quot;Diary of a Divorce,&quot; which chronicles a woman going through a breakup while still living with her partner.</p>
<p>Ishihara said Calen is also offering special content to help attract the women who are using the Net at lunch time.</p>
<p>&quot;There is great potential here. Maybe we can provide a service that will act as a gateway for women&quot; to get on to the Internet, she said.</p>
