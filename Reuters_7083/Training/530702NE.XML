<p>Spyglass Inc shares rose more than 26 percent Wednesday after the company reported earnings in line with expectations and cited software licensing deals with key companies, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been a lot of disappointments this quarter&quot; with companies not meeting expectations, said Dawn Simon, Advest Inc's vice president of software research.  &quot;I think they're being rewarded for being up front and executing well.&quot;  </p>
<p>Spyglass reported fiscal second quarter earnings of $0.16 a share including a one-time payment from Microsoft Corp and a one-time charge of about $900,000 a share for closing its Champaign, Ill., office. Last year, the company posted a $0.06 a share net profit.</p>
<p>According to First Call, the consensus estimate was $0.20 a share excluding the charge -- pegged by analysts at $0.04 a share -- but including the payment.</p>
<p>&quot;The fear that they might miss the quarter is gone,&quot; Nesbitt Burns analyst Abi Gami said.</p>
<p>Gami said Spyglass's deal with International Business Machines Corp was also positive for the company, which last year announced a strategy to create software and services to link non-personal computer devices to the Internet. Spyglass also has a key deal with Xerox Corp.</p>
<p>Spyglass said IBM licensed its Device Mosaic software for the IBM Network Station, its network computer which began shipping this week.</p>
<p>&quot;That's more visibility, and that's what investors were wanting,&quot; Gami said.</p>
<p>Shares of Spyglass traded 1-5/8 higher at 7-3/4.</p>
