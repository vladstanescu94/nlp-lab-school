<p>Strong initial market support for high speed Internet access company At Home Corp. could set the stage for a new wave of Web-related offerings, analysts said.</p>
<p>But few see the next wave, which is widely expected to begin picking up steam after the summer, replicating the all-out bonanza of the spring 1996 Internet rush in which money-loosing startups flooded onto public markets.</p>
<p>At Home shares roared out of the starting blocks on Friday, briefly jumping as high as $25.50, nearly 2.5 times the price of $10.50 underwriters had set, before closing at $17 a share, up 62 percent.</p>
<p>The company, which is backed by several large U.S. cable operators, promises to deliver content from its parallel Internet network over cable modems at up to 300 times the speeds of conventional telephone links.</p>
<p>&quot;Content is king, distribution rules, but speed is divine,&quot; Steve Harmon, an analyst at Mecklermedia Inc.'s iWorld, said of At Home.</p>
<p>Friday's closing price valued At Home at nearly $2 billion, although it is losing money and expects substantial losses for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>At Home was not last week's only high flying Internet stock. Internet search and navigation company Yahoo! Inc. and online bookseller Amazon.com, which went public in May, both hit new highs. Yahoo! posted a profit and Amazon reported a narrower than expected loss.</p>
<p>These stocks are among the top-performing Internet companies in a sector where analysts now see only the most promising companies holding their value, with many others have slumped below their offer price.</p>
<p>&quot;The facts are that these companies over the last two years went out at much higher values than they should have,&quot; said Anthony Perkins, editor in chief of Red Herring, a magazine on the high tech venture industry.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Internet and corporate networks using Web technology known as intranets are now viewed as a key driver in the growth of the computer industry.</p>
<p>The relatively sedate market for high tech share offerings over the year has also allowed an inventory of new deals begin to ripen.</p>
<p>&quot;The market will go hot in the autumn, jump back in and buy these things,&quot; Tim Draper, a third-generation Silicon Valley venture capitalist and a partner in the firm of Draper Fisher Jurvetson, recently predicted.</p>
<p>For one thing, venture capital firms are continuing to invest heavily in Internet-related companies.</p>
<p>In the first quarter venture capital funds more than doubled to $309 million in 93 Internet-related companies, compared with $148 million invested in 40 companies a year ago, according to a recent survey by Price Waterhouse.</p>
<p>However, the Price Waterhouse quarterly survey also found investment was weighted more heavily towards startup and early stage companies which usually take at least a few years before they are ready to complete an IPO.</p>
<p>A strong recent inflow of cash into venture funds shows some continued support for the model established by Netscape Communications Corp., that fast growth companies can go public even without a record of profits.</p>
<p>Many of the Internet companies which followed Netscape's August 1995 stock market debut had fewer than two years of operating history in the fledgling Internet market and no immediate prospect of making a profit.</p>
<p>Overall, more than 250 venture-backed companies raised roughly $12 billion in initial public offerings last year - a jump of 44 percent over 1995 - and the average IPO raised $45 million, up 130 percent from a year earlier, according to the VentureOne investment service.</p>
<p>A growing portion of these are Internet-related, although some warn that too much money may be chasing too few true market opportunities, inflating valuations.</p>
<p>&quot;The Internet wave I think will be three times larger than the PC wave, and to fund that will take a lot more money,&quot; said Perkins.</p>
<p>However, he said, &quot;there's probably an oversupply of venture capital.&quot; (sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400)</p>
