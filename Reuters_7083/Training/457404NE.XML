<p>Hewlett-Packard Co. jumped solidly into the Microsoft Windows NT camp on Wednesday, saying it would &quot;aggressively integrate&quot; the operating system into its computers and spend tens of millions of dollars on joint strategies.</p>
<p>HP Chairman and CEO Lewis Platt, appearing at a news conference with Microsoft Corp Chairman and CEO Bill Gates, said the companies would work together on a broad range of products and services aimed at reducing computing costs.  </p>
<p>At one time Hewlett-Packard dismissed Windows NT, designed for the servers that run computer networks. Platt said customer demand was behind the decision to embrace it.</p>
<p>&quot;It's all built around input from our customers,&quot; he said in a news conference at HP's corporate headquarters in Palo Alto.</p>
<p>Support for Windows NT -- only one aspect of the collaboration announced by the companies -- corresponds to HP's plan to develop a new processor with Intel Corp capable of running both NT and Unix software.  </p>
<p>HP's warming to Microsoft could cause some discomfort to the company's partners, especially Netscape Communications Corp, Microsoft's Internet arch-rival. HP forged an alliance last May with Netscape to help companies build Internet-based internal networks on Unix and NT systems, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our strategic direction is to provide choices and interoperability between choices,&quot; said one HP executive, called on by Platt and other HP executives to answer a question on whether HP will continue to support Novell Inc.'s directory services, as announced last week.  </p>
<p>HP executives have stressed that the company wants to stay clear of the battles raging between Microsoft and Silicon Valley companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc.</p>
<p>But David Tremblay, an analyst at Computer Intelligence/ Infocorp, said the next year may bring confusion for HP's customers if, for example, its neutrality prevents HP from making firm recommendations on software suppliers.</p>
<p>The deal also strikes a blow for HP rival Digital Equipment Corp, which has worked with Microsoft on Windows NT for five years. Digital's speedy Alpha chip is the only 64-bit microprocessor that currently runs NT.  </p>
<p>&quot;The strength of HP is really quite impressive,&quot; Gates said in response to a question about how the deal may affect Microsoft's alliance with Digital. &quot;We've got a lot of breadth here.&quot;</p>
<p>The demand for services and support for NT now exceeds what has been available on the market before the deal with HP, which has a wide array of reseller partners, Gates said.</p>
<p>&quot;Digital's jumping up and down about NT, but they're not exactly blowing the doors off of it,&quot; one analyst said.  </p>
<p>The growth of Windows NT is building steam, according to Gates, who showed a slide in which sales of Windows NT Server licenses were approaching 250,000 in the fourth quarter of 1996, up from around 150,000 in the first quarter last year. &quot;HP is pragmatic, if nothing else,&quot; said Scott Miller, an analyst at Dataquest. But he cautioned that HP faced a challenge as it drew more technologgy from partners such as Intel and Microsoft, making it more difficult for the company to &quot;own the customer&quot; as closely as in the past.</p>
