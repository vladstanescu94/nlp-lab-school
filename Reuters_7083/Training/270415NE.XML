<p>Unnerved investers sold shares in Dendrite International Inc on Friday after the company said contract delays would hurt its fourth quarter and 1997 earnings.</p>
<p>Shares in the Morristown, N.J.-based maker of sales-force management software were down about 59 percent in late morning trading, tumbling 11-3/8 to 8-1/4.</p>
<p>Late Thursday Dendrite said it expected to report a loss for its fourth quarter because it did not receive &quot;certain new business and business-expansion commitments.&quot;  </p>
<p>It said the delays would adversely affect the revenue and income of the company throughout 1997.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected the company to report a profit of $0.21 a share in the fourth quarter and earn $0.83 a share in 1997, according to First Call.</p>
<p>The company also pointed to costs from higher-than-expected research and development spending and the hiring of staff to service the product rollouts delayed by customers.  </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said it removed Dendrite from its recommended list, downgrading it to market perform. The Goldman analyst was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>In a conference call Thursday, Dendrite chief executive John Bailye said he was not immediately able to quantify the &quot;variance&quot; the contract delays would cause in the company's 1997 earnings.</p>
<p>However, Bailye said, &quot;It is my belief that the company is as soundly based in its business relationships with its customers as was ever the case.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the contract delays &quot;do not point to any weakness in the business in its fundamentals or its execution.&quot;</p>
<p>Dendrite vice president of finance Chuck Warczakowski said he expected to be able to give specific guidance to analysts regarding the company's 1997 earnings when it reports its fourth quarter results on February 11.</p>
