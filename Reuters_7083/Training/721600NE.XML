<title>USA: ADR REPORT-British Telecom takes a beating.</title>
<headline>ADR REPORT-British Telecom takes a beating.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>British Telecommunications Plc took a beating in Friday morning trade in European ADRs, falling more than seven percent in price as investors reacted to partner MCI Communications Corp's poor earnings forecast, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;British Telecom is really having a rough day (in New York),&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>The company's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) were trading at 75-5/16, down 6-4/16, or 7.66 percent, from Thursday's close. British Telecom was the third biggest percentage loser on the New York Stock Exchange.  </p>
<p>One trader said the ADRs appeared to be stabilizing after their early fall.</p>
<p>MCI, the long-distance phone company with which British Telecom is to merge, said late yesterday it foresaw higher than expected losses for the second half of 1997 and 1998 due to heavy investments to extend its reach into U.S. local phone markets.</p>
<p>In London, British Telecom said today it could not rule out renegotiating its $24 billion merger with MCI.  </p>
<p>The trader said the fall in BT ADRs was not as severe since the London stock market -- where the company's common stock is listed -- had absorbed the brunt of the impact.</p>
<p>&quot;It won't go down as much as it did earlier in the day,&quot; he said. &quot;It's old news. People have had time to react.&quot;</p>
<p>Brazil's Telebras SA was one of the more active Latin American ADRs. It was down 2-3/8 at 157-3/8 after two rating announcements hit the market.  </p>
<p>ING Barings cut its rating on Telebras to hold from buy, saying its decision was based on the stock's valuation and the results of the B-Band cellular auction for Region 1 in Brazil.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch reiterated its buy rating on Telebras and raised its 12-month price target to $200 for its ADR.</p>
<p>Latin American trading was otherwise quiet.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been a thin day,&quot; said a trader. &quot;One of the quieter days we've seen this week.&quot;  </p>
<p>British company Danka Business Systems Plc was 1-3/16 higher at 38-5/8 and Canadian stock Discreet Logic Inc was up 2-5/16 at 22-3/4.</p>
<p>Overall, the 814-strong ADR group was up 0.33 percent in early afternoon trading.</p>
<p>ADRs allow U.S. trade of foreign shares.</p>
