<text>
<p>Options on Cheyenne Software Inc were busy Monday as the stock rallied sharply after Computer Associates said it would buy Cheyenne for $30.50 per share, or about $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>The deal drove Cheyenne Software shares up 7-5/8 to 30 on consolidated volume of 13.6 million shares by 1240 CDT (1740 GMT). The stock reached a high of 30-1/4.</p>
<p>Traders said the deal touched off a flurry of trading in Cheyenne options early but that action slowed by afternoon.</p>
<p>Recent trading in the options did not suggest that some investors were tipped off on the deal, traders said.  </p>
<p>Michael Schwartz, a managing director at Oppenheimer &amp; Co, said volume in the Cheyenne October 22-1/2 call over the last two weeks averaged around 300 to 400 contracts a day.</p>
<p>&quot;It just didn't happen overnight,&quot; he said of the activity. &quot;It's not something that came out of the blue.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said such a deal had been rumored more than once earlier in the year.</p>
<p>The Cheyenne October 22-1/2 call traded more than 1,700 contracts by 1230 CDT (1730 GMT). It had open interest of 2,340 and was up 6-7/8 at 7-5/8. The December 20 call traded 1,165 contracts and the December 22-1/2 traded 1,025.  </p>
<p>A trader at the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) said investors long the calls were selling off the opening and that activity was seen from both retail and institutional investors.</p>
<p>With the stock rallying, few Cheyenne puts were active. The March 1997 22-1/2 put traded 110 contracts.</p>
<p>Computer Associates options were not busy except for the October 65 call, which traded about 460 contracts.</p>
<p>A trader at the CBOE said volatility on the Computer Associates options did not move.  </p>
<p>He said recent trading was also thin except for some buying of front-month calls.</p>
<p>&quot;Earnings are coming out and you do tend to see people buying front-month calls ahead of earnings,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Computer Associates shares were up 1/2 at 63-1/4 on consolidated volume of 997,000.</p>
<p>In other trading, Westell Technologies Inc October 30 put traded more than 3,000 contracts after the stock slumped sharply.</p>
<p>Westell shares were off 12-5/8, or 27 percent, at 33-3/4 on 2.7 million shares.  </p>
<p>The stock fell after France's Alcatel Telecom said it was chosen to supply ASDL modems by four regoinal Bell companies, a blow to Westell, which trade press reports said had been expected to share in the order.</p>
<p>The Westell October 30 put had open interest of 20.</p>
<p>The Westell October 35 put, up 2-7/16 at 2-11/16, traded nearly 1,000 contracts. Its open interest was 136.</p>
<p>On the call side, the Westell October 40 call traded nearly 500 contracts. It fell six to 5/8 and its open interest was 213. -Gregory Crawford, 312-408-8750/E-mail: derivatives@reuters.com</p>
