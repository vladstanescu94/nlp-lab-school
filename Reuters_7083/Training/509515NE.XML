<title>USA: Avant! slumps on felony charges.</title>
<headline>Avant! slumps on felony charges.</headline>

<p>Shares of Avant! Corp lost almost half of their value Tuesday after felony charges were filed against the company and its officers.</p>
<p>Avant! was down 11-3/8 to 13-1/8 at midday on Nasdaq on volume of more than four million shares.</p>
<p>The Santa Clara County, Calif., district attorney's office said Monday it had filed felony charges against Avant!, its president and other senior officials for allegedly stealing Cadence Design Systems Inc technology and using it to develop competing products.  </p>
<p>Avant! and Cadence have been bitter rivals for years. They both sell software that helps engineers design the intricate layouts of computer chips.</p>
<p>Avant! has strongly denied the county prosecutor's allegations and says it is confident it will prevail in court.</p>
<p>&quot;If Avant! are found guilty of this the consequences would be pretty dire, but there is a significant part of their business that is not...the subject of this litigation,&quot; said Richard Chu, an analyst at Cowen &amp; Co.  </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley cut its rating on Avant! today to neutral from outperform.</p>
<p>For more than a year, Cadence has been pressing its own civil action against Avant!, alleging its rival stole some of its programming codes and used them in its own products.</p>
<p>All of the Avant! officials charged are former employees of Cadence, the prosecutor said.</p>
<p>The prosecutor's office said each defendant, if convicted, could be sentenced to up to seven years in state prison.</p>
<p>Cadence said it will continue to press its civil action against Avant! in federal court.</p>
