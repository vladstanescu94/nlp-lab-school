<p>A regional push by Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (SingTel) is stumbling, analysts said on Monday after the company said it was pulling out of a cellular telephone licence bid in India's Tamil Nadu state.</p>
<p>The withdrawal came soon after SingTel's failed attempt to break into Taiwan's telecommunications market, where it lost out in bidding for paging licences in January.</p>
<p>SingTel had earlier failed to win one of the eight mobile telephone services licences in Taiwan worth US$3.6 billion.  </p>
<p>&quot;SingTel need to invest overseas. With the cancellation of the (Tamil Nadu) contract coming pretty hot in the heels of Taiwan's paging license, people are saying its regional efforts aren't going as smoothly as they would like,&quot; David Leow, associate director at HSBC-James Capel, told Reuters.</p>
<p>SingTel chief Lee Hsien Yang said the company decided to quit the consortium which bidded for the cellular telephone licence in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu because the project would be not viable if SingTel had to top up the bid.  </p>
<p>SingTel, HCL Ltd and the Hinduja group, were the second highest bidder in a tender for two licences in Tamil Nadu with a bid of 5.41 billion rupees. The highest bidder was US West and BPL LTD at 8.36 billion rupees.</p>
<p>The Indian tender required the second highest bidder to match the top bid to secure the second license and SingTel wa looking to divest its stake of just under 50 percent in the consortium, Lee said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Though SingTel has been trying very hard to increase their overseas portfolio, they have not been very successful in the past couple of years,&quot; said Alayne Wong, investment analyst at GK Goh Research.</p>
<p>Wong said SingTel stock could fall below S$3.10, possibly to S$2.80, in the next year due to pressures on revenues.</p>
<p>She said one pressure was the U.S. call to lower settlement rates, cuts in international call charges and increased competition in the domestic cellular phone market.  </p>
<p>Wong said SingTel could suffer a six percent loss in revenue if settlement rates -- which phone companies pay each other for completing international calls -- are lowered.</p>
<p>Washington is pushing for lower rates because it pays out billions of dollars more than it takes in, partly because of call-back services which take advantage of U.S. charges much lower than the international average.</p>
<p>Wong said SingTel's call volumes had not risen much despite several rate cuts which have lopped 36 percent off the price of an average international phone call in the past five years to S$1.70 a minute from S$2.67.  </p>
<p>SingTel's monopoly on basic telecommunications services expires in 2000, with Singapore's second a mobile phone and paging services due to start next month.</p>
<p>Leow said SingTel's regional prospects could improve following the World Trade Organisation's pact to liberalise the telecommunications market.</p>
<p>&quot;After the WTO accord in February, the telecommunications market that will be available to players like SingTel will be another 17-19 percent, or a five fold increase,&quot; Leow said.  </p>
<p>&quot;I still think the markets like Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia opening up, there will be more opportunities in the region for SingTel to enter and at a lower risk (than India),&quot; Leow said.</p>
