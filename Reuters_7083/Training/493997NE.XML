<headline>INTERVIEW - Dow Jones takes aim at rivals.</headline>

<p>Dow Jones &amp; Co Inc said its alliance with Microsoft Corp is aimed at getting a foothold in two fast-growing markets dominated by rivals -- &quot;buy side&quot; financial information and electronic transaction systems.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to expand into the buy side which we think will grow faster and where Bloomberg (LP) has done well,&quot; Geoffrey Moore, senior vice president of strategic communications at Dow Jones Markets, told Reuters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Dow Jones said on Tuesday it plans to use Internet standards and Microsoft's software and products to help it.  </p>
<p>Moore said the buy side -- fund managers and wealthy individuals -- was a relatively untapped market for Dow Jones Markets but was growing faster than the &quot;sell-side&quot; of big trading rooms which account for most revenues now.</p>
<p>Moore said the two firms would work together on a growing package of services compatible with standard computer equipment and software, helping bring financial information and electronic trading out of specialist environments.</p>
<p>These would include advanced analytics and historical databases, which its rivals already have, and dispensing with page-based information in favor of Internet standards.  </p>
<p>No financial details were given, but Dow Jones said the initiative is part of plans to spend $650 million over four years revamping its financial information services unit, formerly called Telerate.</p>
<p>Moore said there would not be a joint company and neither side would be making equity investments though both companies would market the products to respective clients.</p>
<p>Moore said that the market for financial information services was expected to grow to $8.5 billion by the end of 1999 from $6.5 billion in 1997, and Dow Jones was planning to get 17.5 percent of it by 1999 from 14.5 percent now.  </p>
<p>Dow Jones now has big plans to push into electronic transaction systems in which news and information company Reuters Holdings Plc is a major player.</p>
<p>&quot;Transactions is a business that Reuters has been a major player in, and it is a $1 billion a year revenue business for them,&quot; said Moore.</p>
<p>Reuters has a share transaction system called Instinet and a foreign exchange dealing system, but Dow Jones wants to offer transactions in bonds, commodity and energy markets in addition to equities and foreign exchange.  </p>
<p>Moore said that Dow Jones would use the transaction system company Optimark, in which it owns a minority stake, as a foundation for its electronic transaction systems.</p>
<p>Moore said its first offerings will be available by the end of this year, including a trading system for U.S. Treasury securities and further expansion in equities similar to its British venture with Primark Corp's Datastream.</p>
<p>&quot;You will see a similar alliance in Asia fairly soon,&quot; Moore said.</p>
<p>Analysts say other industry players have been pushing towards open systems for some years.</p>
<p>Reuters now has many systems on standard personal computers, while privately-owned Bloomberg has launched a datafeed system called the Open Bloomberg to supplement its proprietary terminal.</p>
<p>Moore said that Dow Jones would spend $140 million to $150 million this year and more in 1998 of the four year $650 million budget. Much of this would go to upgrading internal systems to an open architecture to be ready by end 1999.</p>
