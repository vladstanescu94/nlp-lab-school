<p>U.S. corporate earnings for the first quarter of 1997 have been better than expected with a peppy economy helping companies out on the bottom line.</p>
<p>&quot;You've seen a lot of companies senstive to the economy doing better than expected on the bottom line,&quot; said Bill Miller, chief investment officer at IDS Equity Advisors. He said the economy boosts the &quot;top line&quot; where the revenue shows up and with cost controls in place more of that revenue winds up as profit.  </p>
<p>With first-quarter earnings already out from banks, brokers, media companies, consumer products companies, the automakers and quite a few technology companies, surprises of a positive nature dominated over the disappointments.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is continuing to reward those with good performance,&quot; siad Karl Rauch, managing director of Rubicon Holdings Inc, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa.-based asset manager. &quot;Those companies that aren't (delivering good earnings) you see getting hit.&quot; He noted that apparel-maker Russell Corp fell 8-1/2 to 27-1/4 Friday after reporting earnings of $0.30 per share, versus the consensus expectation of $0.34.  </p>
<p>Rauch also noted that Microsoft Corp soared Friday after the software company late the previous day reported earnings of $0.79 per share for its fiscal third quarter, compared to the consensus forecast of $0.64.</p>
<p>Hugh Johnson, market strategist at First Albany Co, noted that with not quite half the companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 reporting earnings, 125 beat expectations, 54 were worse than expected. and about 40 were on-target. Johnson said he has not been surprised by the general trend but only with the specifics of some of the reports. &quot;Microsoft, Intel Corp and the autos were pretty darn good,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The banks have generally reported earnings on target, with fee income boosting results and trading helping out at some of the bigger companies.</p>
<p>One analyst thought that Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp had to stretch things to produce earnings that were on-target or slightly better than forecast.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think people can be happy with the quality of the earning,&quot; said Lawrence Cohn of PaineWebber Group Inc, arguing that there was too much reliance on non-recurring gains.  </p>
<p>&quot;If you're in the financial transaction business you can't knock out a transaction because it happened,&quot; countered Thomas Jones, principal financial officer at Citicorp, in an interview. Jones said there were only two things in Citicorp's massive earnings report that he considered &quot;one-timers.&quot; One, he said, was a $50 million after-tax recovery on a settlement with Peru. At the same time the company booked a $72 million pre-tax non-cash expense for performance-based options. He also noted that it was the last of those options.</p>
<p>Citicorp earned $2.01 per share diluted compared to the Institutional Brokers Estimate Systems estimate of $1.99.  </p>
<p>For some companies, sharply higher earnings are leading analysts to revise their full year estimates higher.</p>
<p>Johnson believes profits generally will continue to rise throughout the year but at a slower pace. &quot;I'm not in the camp that says profits will turn down,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think comparisons do get harder as we go through the year,&quot; said Miller. But he said very early in the second quarter the good economic tone of the first quarter seems to be spilling over.</p>
<p>Rauch, who hasn't bought bonds for two years, thinks yields are now at a point where it is time to get back in.</p>
