<p>The Learning Co president Kevin O'Leary expects the company's high debt to be pared to a comfortable level in about three years.</p>
<p>The educational and reference software firm had $471 million in debt as of its first quarter ended in March. That is against annual revenues estimated to be $407 million for 1997 and reported at $343.3 million in 1996. The debt has accumulated from several acquisitions in recent years.</p>
<p>&quot;We take cash flow from operations and buy back debt and we will continue to do that,&quot; O'Leary said in an interview following a presentation at the Hambrecht &amp; Quist Conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We think we have an adequate plan to get that down over three years (to a more comfortable level),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts have been concerned about debt and cited it as one of the company's problems in integrating its acquisitions.</p>
<p>Formerly named SoftKey, the company's most significant acquisition was its 1996 purchase of The Learning Co, to which it recently changed its name.</p>
