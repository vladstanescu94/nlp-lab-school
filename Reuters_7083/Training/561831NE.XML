<p>Microsoft Corp chairman and chief executive officer Bill Gates said Tuesday he saw &quot;very high growth&quot; for the company in the Far East and Latin America.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd say that the Far East and Latin America are the two very high growth areas for Microsoft, and I'm not sure which one will be higher growth,&quot; Gates told reporters during a Microsoft conference with Latin American business leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very excited about what's going on throughout the region&quot; of Latin America, he added. &quot;We see it as a top growth region for us.&quot;  </p>
<p>He gave no specific figures.</p>
<p>Among the company's plans were the introduction of WebTV into Latin America, Gates told a news conference.</p>
<p>Microsoft Corp said in April that it had agreed to acquire privately held WebTV Networks for cash and stock valued at about $425 million in a move aimed at bringing the personal computer and the television closer together.</p>
<p>&quot;Some time this year we'll come up with a plan to put Web TV in Latin America,&quot; he said, adding that the company was considering which partners to link up with in that venture.  </p>
<p>Gates said he had met Costa Rican president Jose Maria Figueres Monday in Miami and discussed projects in which Microsoft might work with the government of the Central American nation.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing concrete&quot; had been agreed, though, he said.</p>
<p>Asked what he expected from a high-technology &quot;summit&quot; he has called of more than 100 of the world's top corporate chief executives in Seattle this week, Gates said:</p>
<p>&quot;It's part of our regular ongoing dialogue with business leaders, and there's people from around the world including Latin America who are joining in to that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Vice President Al Gore is one of the attendees, it's a good group.&quot;</p>
<p>The CEOs would be &quot;talking about how the new competitive environment is both a challenge and and opportunity for businesses of all kinds,&quot; he added.</p>
