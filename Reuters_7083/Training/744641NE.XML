<headline>Netscape names top executive office.</headline>
<dateline>PALO ALTO, Calif. 1997-07-22</dateline>

<p>Netscape Communications Corp Chief Executive Officer Jim Barkesdale said he has formed an executive committee consisting of himself and a triumvirate of senior Netscape executives.</p>
<p>Barkesdale named the trio joining him in the executive group as co-founder Mark Andreessen, executive vice president of products, Executive Vice President of Sales &amp; Marketing Mike Homer and Chief Financial Officer Peter Currie, who will continue to serve as Netscape's chief administrative officer.</p>
<p>&quot;This change is designed to enable us to make better decisions more quickly,&quot; Barkesdale said in a conference call.  </p>
<p>Barkesdale told media in the call the grouping of senior executives replaces more than three times as many executives who had been reporting to him, and was important to ensure that Netscape act decisively and rapidly as it grows.</p>
<p>&quot;It's critical that we get maximum leverage between sales, marketing and product development,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The structure is similar to the Office of the President structure which software giant Microsoft Corp, which is now battling head-to-head with Netscape in the Internet software market, introduced in the early 1990s.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think this is a great change for this company,&quot; said Currie, saying centralizing executives' roles would provide a boost &quot;from my point of view, in terms of trying to steer the financial boat towards a very strong horizon.&quot;</p>
<p>Separately Currie said client software -- such as the company's new Communicator product which includes an Internet browser and other capabilities -- accounted for 39 percent of Netscape's revenues, up from 38 percent in the first quarter, it logged 17 percent sequential revenue growth.</p>
<p>Server software amounted to 34 percent of revenues, compared to 37 percent in the immediately preceding quarter and which he said was strong after two quarters of record growth, and services comprised 27 percent of revenue.</p>
<p>The services portion, which was up from 25 percent in the first quarter and a 16 percent average in prior quarters, and includes content offered from its Netscape web site.</p>
<p>&quot;We view the web site as an important asset and last quarter we were renewing a number of agreements which were just about at their expiration point after having been in place for a year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We discovered that we had a much more real opportunity to deliver our viewers to other advertisers and other content providers than I think we had appreciated before.&quot;</p>
<p>International sales accounted for 30 percent of the total, up from 26 percent in the first quarter, Currie said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the earnings figure of $0.10 a share before non-recurring charges was right in line with consensus estimates, with second quarter revenues fo $135.2 million above many analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>But some also said a previous call with Netscape management had lacked the enthusiasm some felt they had expected from the company in the second half, when it faces a challenge of selling its recently updated products.</p>
<p>&quot;The top line was strong,&quot; said Alex. Brown analyst Mary McCaffrey, but she said there was concern that spending levels will continue to be significant, pinching margins. &quot;I thought they'd be more bullish about the second half.&quot;</p>
