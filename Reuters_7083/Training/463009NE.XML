<p>Investors dumped shares of Medic Computer System Inc after the developer of physician practice management systems said it expects its first quarter earnings and revenues to fall below analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>Medic Computer dropped 13-7/8 to 14-1/8 and was one of the most active Nasdaq issues.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an overreaction.  The forecast is clearly disappointing but the company fundamentals remain strong,&quot; said Jason Rosenbluth.  &quot;The market is relentless with companies that miss their earnings targets.&quot;  </p>
<p>Medic said earlier on Monday that it expects to report first-quarter share earnings of $0.14 to $0.18, below analysts' expectations of about $0.27 per share and the year ago's $0.21 per share.</p>
<p>The company also projected that first-quarter revenues will be below consensus estimates, with total net revenues ranging from $47 million to $49 million.  The expected first quarter revenues compared with total net revenues of $43.37 million a year ago, after restatement for the acquisition of CompuSystems in May 1996 accounted for as a pooling of interests.  </p>
<p>Medic attributed the drop in revenues to lower-than-expected systems sales, primarily in January and February, and to the longer cycle for implementation of the larger MEDIC Vision systems.</p>
<p>Medic said bookings in March have improved and are expected to include significant MEDIC Vision systems.</p>
<p>Analysts said Medic's near-term results will be dampened by the transition to its new product line, but long-term prospects remain strong.</p>
<p>But Medic's sharp stock decline on Monday should not spook holders of other health care information companies since the sector's long-term outlook is rosy, analysts said.</p>
