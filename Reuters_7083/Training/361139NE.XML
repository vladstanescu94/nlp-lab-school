<p>Micro-Integration Corp on Wednesday said it would restate its earnings for the quarters ended June 30 and September 30, 1996, after discovering inappropriate accounting practices and financial controls.</p>
<p>A company spokesman said Micro-Intergration forced Chief Financial Officer Christopher Burgess to resign. The company said he failed to write off some bad debt, amortize certain assets and make proper entries regarding Micro-Integration's Belgian subsidiary, according to the spokesman.  </p>
<p>Micro-Integration said the lack of appropriate financial controls and inaccurate information contributed to an expected loos of $0.10 a share for the quarter ended December 31, 1996.</p>
<p>Those results are expected to be reported next week, the company said.</p>
<p>Micro-Integration expects it will restate results for the quarter ended June 30, 1996, to show a loss of $0.07 per share compared with a  profit of $0.02, reported previously.</p>
<p>It expects to restate results for the quarter ended September 30, 1996, to show a loss of $0.17 per share, compared with a loss $0.08 reported earlier.</p>
<p>Micro-Integration, which developes computer software and hardware, said its January sales were the strongest in its history at $1.3 million.</p>
<p>Ken Tressler, the former chief financial officer, is reviewing the accounting process, while auditors and legal counsel were asked to make independent assessments, the company said.</p>
