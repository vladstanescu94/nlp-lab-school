<title>USA: Spyglass has finances to continue device investing.</title>
<headline>Spyglass has finances to continue device investing.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-23</dateline>

<p>Spyglass Inc said Wednesday it has the money to continue its strategy of developing the Internet device market, despite the new sector's unpredictability.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the financial resources to continue to make the strategic investments both internally and externally that support our objective to widen our leadership position we enjoy today,&quot; chief financial officer Gary Vilchick said in a teleconference with analysts and reporters.  </p>
<p>Spyglass reported second quarter net earnings of $0.16 a share including an $8 million one-time payment from Microsoft Corp and a pre-tax charge of $900,000 for closing an office, versus $0.06 a share last year. Without the one-time items, the company had a loss of $0.14 a share.</p>
<p>Revenues rose to $12.02 million from $5.00 million, and Spyglass said its cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter totaled $36.8 million.</p>
<p>Late last year Spyglass announced a strategy to provide software and services to link everyday devices such as cellular phones and televisions to the Internet.  </p>
<p>During the second quarter, Spyglass announced three key products and landed various licensing deals with manufacturers such as Xerox Corp, International Business Machines Corp and Network Computing Devices. Spyglass's software is also used in WebTV Networks, which agreed earlier this month to be acquired by Microsoft.</p>
<p>&quot;What we've learned in the last six months is validating our vision,&quot; chief executive Doug Colbeth said on the teleconference. &quot;We still have a lot of work ahead of us. We still remain cautious about the near-term predictability within this emerging market.&quot;  </p>
<p>Colbeth said the initial licensing agreements range in size from $200,000 to $500,000, depending on whether the purchaser uses Spyglass's professional services to customize the software, for example.</p>
<p>Those agreements are for product trials, and Spyglass said it expects full deployment by the device manufacturers and subsequently larger licensing agreements in nine to 12 months. But the company remains cautious.  </p>
<p>&quot;Until we start seeing the deployment cycle kick in, which we feel is still nine to 12 months out, it's very difficult for us to give you guidance as to what kind of royalty trend to expect,&quot; Colbeth said. &quot;We're certainly doing deals with companies that have very significant distribution channels.&quot;</p>
<p>Gross profit margins rose to 90 percent from the first quarter's 88 percent, largely as a result of the Microsoft buyout, Spyglass said. But the company said margins were lower than 1996 second quarter's 91.2 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to anticipate gross profit margins will trend slightly downward as professional services revenue becomes a more significant portion of our total revenue base,&quot; Vilchick said.</p>
<p>Professional services, a group which provides customer service and customizes software, provides the lowest gross margin of all revenues, the company said. Professional services revenues rose 33 percent versus last year.</p>
