<p>Interactive entertainment company Spectrum HoloByte Inc Tuesday, said it expects to report a first quarter loss of at least $0.22 to $0.28 a share.</p>
<p>In a statement, the company said it expects net revenues for the current fiscal quarter ending June 29 to be between $13 million and $16 million.  Spectrum attributed the shortfall to lower than expected initial orders of new products and lower than expected sales of back catalog titles. According to First Call, analysts expected the company to post a loss of $0.09 a share in the first quarter.  </p>
<p>In the year-ago quarter, Spectrum reported a loss of $1.5 million or $0.07 a share after a one-time gain of $2.7 million. Revenues were $13 million.</p>
<p>Spectrum said it is reviewing the book value of certain equity investments in strategic partnerships. If it determined the book value of such investments had declined, Spectrum said the first quarter loss could exceed its estimates.</p>
<p>The company said Star Trek Generations, which launched last month, is selling &quot;reasonably well&quot; when compared with most new titles in the marketplace but initial domestic shipments have been below expectations.  </p>
<p>&quot;In addition, domestically our back catalog is also off from previous quarters, and worldwide gross margins are down because our two newest properties - Star Trek Generations and Magic: The Gathering - are licensed properties,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>Shipments of Magic: The Gathering - launched in the last quarter of fiscal 1996 - have surpassed 235,000 units worldwide, but the company said it had expected stronger sales during the current quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;The company believes that orders have slowed in part because Magic: The Gathering consumers have indicated that they want on-line, multiplayer, tournament support as well as add-on decks and improved artificial intelligence,&quot; the company said, adding it is planning to add these features through expansion packs.</p>
