<headline>U.S. Justice Dept. allows Microsoft to buy WebTV.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-08-01</dateline>

<p>The Justice Department said Friday it  approved Microsoft Corp.'s proposed $425 million acquisition of WebTV  Networks Inc., which offers Internet access using televisions.</p>
<p>After what it described as a &quot;thorough investigation,&quot; the department  said it had closed the probe into whether the acquisition would violate  antitrust laws and decided not to challenge the deal, which was announced  in April.</p>
<p>Microsoft said it completed the deal late on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The investigation confirmed that a number of other companies, several  of whom are significant participants in the computer or consumer electronics  industries, have or will soon enter the market with competitive products  and alternative technologies,&quot; the department said in a brief statement.</p>
<p>The department in May requested additional information about the deal  after a number of Microsoft's competitors complained it could lessen  competition.</p>
<p>WebTV designs the specifications for TV set-top boxes and built-in  television connections that allow for accessing the Internet. It offers  Internet service through agreements with service providers that supply  connections around the nation.</p>
<p>Steve Perlman, WebTV's chief executive officer, said this week that  he expects to reach 250,000 subscribers by the end of the year, more  than double the current number of users. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based  firm has nearly 400 employees.</p>
<p>Opponents of the deal charged that WebTV represented another way to  access the World Wide Web, along with the personal computer brower  software already sold by Microsoft. They argued the deal would increase  Microsoft's ability to dominate access to the Web.</p>
<p>The department over the years has conducted a number of investigations  involving Microsoft and still has underway a long-running antitrust  investigation of Microsoft's Internet software business.</p>
<p>The department sued to block Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Intuit  Inc. for $2.3 billion in 1995, a deal the software giant later abandoned.</p>
<p>In 1994, the department negotiated a consent decree that set restrictions  on Microsoft's practices in the market for computer operating systems.</p>
