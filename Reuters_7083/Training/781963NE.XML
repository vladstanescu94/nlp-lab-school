<p>Microsoft's decision to invest $150 million in Apple Computer is unlikely to raise antitrust objections and might even help competition, antitrust lawyers said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Apple Computer Inc. adviser Steve Jobs announced Wednesday that software giant Microsoft Corp. will buy $150 million in Apple stock over the next three years. Under the deal, the two companies will have broad cross-licensing agreements, and Apple will bundle Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser into its Macintosh operating system.</p>
<p>By helping keep a flagging competitor alive, analysts said the investment could deflect criticism that Microsoft has been unfairly dominating the computer industry.</p>
<p>&quot;It could easily be this would improve competition within the industry as a whole,&quot; said Gordon Spivack, an antitrust lawyer with Coudert Brothers in New York. &quot;Microsoft probably has an interest in helping Apple be one of the competing systems.&quot;</p>
<p>Steve Sunshine of law firm Shearman and Sterling in Washington was equally untroubled.</p>
<p>&quot;What's all the fuss?&quot; he said. He added that although some people have raised questions about making Microsoft's Internet Explorer the default browser on the Macintosh, the Mac OS accounted for only a small percentage of overall personal computer sales.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see how (that) changes much of anything,&quot; he said of the decision to bundle the browser with the Mac OS. &quot;The question of whether the platform has any vitality left is an open issue.&quot;</p>
<p>President Clinton said Wednesday he was waiting to hear from the Justice Department on whether the plan had antitrust implications.</p>
<p>&quot;We will treat them in the same way as we would anyone else and make the analysis in law that seems appropriate to the Justice Department,&quot; Clinton told a news conference. &quot;I have to wait to hear from them about whether there are any antitrust implications to this.&quot;</p>
<p>On Friday, the Justice Department approved Microsoft's proposed $420 million acquisition of Web TV Networks Inc., which offers Internet access using television, after what regulators described as a &quot;thorough investigation&quot; into the deal's potential antitrust impact.</p>
