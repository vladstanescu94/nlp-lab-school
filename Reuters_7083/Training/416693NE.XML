<title>USA: Broderbund sees Q2 results below forecasts.</title>
<headline>Broderbund sees Q2 results below forecasts.</headline>
<dateline>NOVATO, Calif. 1997-03-04</dateline>

<p>Broderbund Software Inc said Tuesday it expects to report earnings of between $0.15 and $0.20 per share excluding charges in the second quarter on sales of $41 to $44 million, which it said will be below analyst forecasts.</p>
<p>The consensus estimate for the company's second quarter net income is $0.31 per share, according to First Call.</p>
<p>The company said that while unit volume was up over 30 percent for the last three months, results were hurt by reduced prices.  </p>
<p>Broderbund said second quarter earnings will also include charges associated with the acquisition of Living Books, the maker of educational software, which in January Broderbund reached an agreement to acquire.</p>
<p>In the year-ago second quarter, Broderbund reported second quarter earnings of $0.87 per share, or $0.45 after excluding gains it realized when its agreement to merge with The Learning Co were terminated.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest forecast, Chief Executive Officer Joe Durrett said, &quot;We believe the improvement in our business is still moving ahead, but it will probably take a few months longer than previously anticipated.&quot;</p>
<p>The company expects to report results on March 20.</p>
<p>Broderbund, which makes interactive software, has for the last few years relied heavily on the best-selling Myst mystery-adventure game to boost sales.</p>
<p>But sales of the game began falling sharply last year, as a rash of new products by competitors cut into Broderbund's market.</p>
