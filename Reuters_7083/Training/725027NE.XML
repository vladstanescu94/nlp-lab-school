<p>Netscape Communications Corp. will Monday introduce a new pricing structure for suites of its Internet server products aimed at simplifying purchases for customers and resellers.</p>
<p>Netscape executives said ahead of Monday's pricing announcement the company also aims to shore up support for resellers in a bid to increase the proportion of its sales achieved through third parties at lower cost to Netscape.  </p>
<p>Netscape will refer sales to customers with fewer than 500 &quot;seats&quot; -- individual computers linked by a network -- exclusively through its resellers, said Rom Shriram, vice president of worldwide indirect channel sales.</p>
<p>The split between indirect sales and direct sales in Netscape's March quarter was around 50-50, Shriram noted, saying over time the company expects a majority of its business will go through its partners.</p>
<p>The Netscape executives declined to provide specific targets for indirect sales or to project how the new pricing plan will impact results going forward, however.  </p>
<p>To simplify pricing and encourage its partners to sell its solutions over those of rivals Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus division, Netscape said it will introduce two new server packages.</p>
<p>Customers will be able to buy a newly updated SuiteSpot 3.1 Standard Edition later this quarter with a license for 50 users for $3,495 and SuiteSpot Professional Edition with a 50 user license for $4,750.</p>
<p>This compares with $4,995 price tag Netscape currently places on its basic package, which includes five of its server products plus a license for 100 users.  </p>
<p>The new 50-user licensing pack pricing takes effect August 1, with the standard SuiteSpot 3.1 package available later this quarter and the professional edition due in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
<p>The standard edition server package is designed to work in a variety of applications ranging from content management and messaging to applications Netscape calls crossware, which runs on internal corporate networks.  </p>
<p>This version also includes up-to-date calendar, discussion and directory server capabilities as well as a choice between development versions of Informix or Oracle workgroup server software.</p>
<p>The professional edition product is aimed at enabling customers to deploy more sophisticated networks, adding more advanced management capabilities while including all the software available in the standard edition.  </p>
<p>Additional software include Netscape Compass Server 3.0, a new offering containing a personal profiling tool based on technology created by grapeVINE Technologies, a three-year-old startup company based in Troy, Michigan.</p>
<p>The professional edition package also includes a new set of centralized management tools called Netscape Mission Control, a proxy server for replicating and filtering Web content, and a server for issuing digital certificates and protecting online privacy.  </p>
<p>Raj Gossain, a Netscape product manager, said the new products offer a more tightly integrated package than its previous offerings, which he said will be easier to deploy and which Netscape hopes will attract a broader market.</p>
<p>Netscape currently has some 2,000 resellers in the United States and a total of 2,800 on a worldwide basis.</p>
<p>Netscape said it plans to work closely with partners to sell to large enterprise customers, and said it has also introduced a new volume purchasing program for customers worldwide it had dubbed Charters.</p>
<p>The Charters program reduces the threshold for volume pricing to 100 seats, or users, from 500 previously and allows customers to aggregate purchases across product lines and over time. The company's new team-selling approach will be rolled out in August, it said. (sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400)</p>
