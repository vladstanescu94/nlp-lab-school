<p>Former Apple CEO John Sculley said on Sunday he was joining the board of Catalyst, parent company of HK Strategy &amp; Finance Ltd, an Israel-based investment firm specialising in the Israeli high-tech industry.</p>
<p>Sculley, chief executive officer of California-based Internet software developer Live Picture and a self-styled venture &quot;catalyst&quot;, has had a business relationship with HK for several years.</p>
<p>&quot;We are actively involved in several projects. We are not making any announcements today as to what those are. But I think you will see in the relatively near term a number of examples of activities that HK and I are involved with,&quot; Sculley said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think you will see a variety of things which will include investments,&quot; he told a news conference at which he said he was joining the Catalyst board of European merchant bankers and industrialists.</p>
<p>HK president Robin Hacke said the investment firm, which describes its business as building networks among U.S. European and Israeli partners, was &quot;actively looking for additional companies, in the fields of software and communications in particular, where we can be active and involved&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Part of what John will be doing during the time that he's here is looking at some additional opportunities and he expects to be here again,&quot; she said at the news conference.</p>
<p>Sculley is in Israel for a week to attend an Internet conference.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll probably be here...about four visits a year,&quot; he said.</p>
