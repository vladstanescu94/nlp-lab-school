<p>Microsoft Corp will spend about $2.1 billion on research and development in fiscal 1997, up from $1.43 billion in fiscal 1996, a group vice president said.</p>
<p>The 1997 spending will focus on improving its Windows family of programs, its Microsoft Office suite of business software, and on its Internet technology, said Jeff Raikes, group vice president, speaking at the Montgomery Securities Investment Conference.</p>
<p>Raikes said Microsoft plans to make &quot;significant investment&quot; in Microsoft Office, adding that the investment should result in one of the most substantial upgrades of the business package in many years.  </p>
<p>Raikes also commented on earlier news reports that Microsoft's margin could erode as only a &quot;possibility&quot; and added later in an interview that Microsoft &quot;sees no evidence of it year.&quot;</p>
<p>He told the Montgomery audience that &quot;there is the possibility that over time, as our success climbs, there is some possibility of saturation.&quot;</p>
<p>As reported earlier, Microsoft's fiscal 1996 10K report filed with U.S. regulators mentioned the possibility of slower sales growth in the first two quarters of this year compared with big gains in fiscal 1996 which ended June 30.</p>
<p>It said the possible slower sales coupled with increased expenses could squeeze margins.</p>
<p>Raikes said that so far this year &quot;our sell through is up year over year.&quot;</p>
<p>Two other product areas Microsoft will stress this year are its Windows NT server software and its Internet browser.</p>
<p>&quot;An area fundamental to our success in the business market is our Windows NT server,&quot; Raikes said.</p>
<p>Raikes said that independent research firms say sales of Windows NT servers are surpassing sales of other mainstream PC network operating systems, mainly Novell Inc's NetWare 4.1.</p>
<p>Regarding Microsofts's Internet Explorer browser, he said Microsoft plans to &quot;make the browser a seamless addition to how people use the computer,&quot; with plans to integrate the browser in all of its operating systems and have built in links to the browser in all of its applications.</p>
