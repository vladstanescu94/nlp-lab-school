<headline>SCO sees weak second quarter results.</headline>
<dateline>SANTA CRUZ, Calif. 1997-04-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Santa Cruz Operation Inc said Tuesday it expects earnings for its second quarter will be weaker than the comparable year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>The company said in a statement it expects earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter, ended March 31, to range from $0.02 and $0.05 a share, versus $0.08 a share for the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Revenues for the second quarter will be between $53 million and $55 million, up from $50.7 million for the year-ago quarter.  </p>
<p>SCO plans to report second quarter and six month results on April 25.</p>
<p>The company said second quarter revenues were affected by weak sales in Europe. Higher spending on new projects, especially Gemini and Tarantella, also reduced earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;While sales of our products were strong and growing in North America, South America and the Pacific Rim, European sales underperformed, primarily in France and Germany,&quot; said Alok Mohan, president and chief executive officer of SCO.</p>
<p>&quot;We are conducting an in-depth review of European operations to improve the situation during the third quarter.</p>
<p>The company said that, whie it is investing heavily in new products it is cutting other expenses to counter the increased new product development expenditures that should result in reduced near term expenses.</p>
