<p>Lehman Brothers said it was maintaining its 1-Buy rating for Logal Educational Software &amp; Systems Ltd despite the company's announcements that third quarter revenues and earnings would be lower than expected.</p>
<p>A loss of $0.04 a share is now expected instead of a profit of $0.05 forecast by analysts.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that Logal still represents an early stage technology company with a great deal of promise, a strong product suite and which participates in a market that is likely to generate increased interest over the next 12 months,&quot; Lehman said in a report.</p>
<p>&quot;Management has told us that the revenue shortfall is primarily due to lower sales from its direct sales force, which is responsible for closing larger orders with schools and school districts. The inside telemarketing sales effort and co-development revenue stream (joint development projects with Prentice-Hall and Houghton Mifflin) appear to be on track.&quot;</p>
<p>Logal is committing more of its resources to delivering its products via on-line distribution, which will play a pivotal role in the company's prospects in 1997, the report said.</p>
<p>Lehman cut its fourth-quarter estimate to a loss of $0.11 a share from a loss of $0.01 and scaled back its revenue forecast to $1.3 million from $2.3 million.</p>
<p>It estimates 1997 revenue at $14.7 million, up from an estimated $6.7 million in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;We are assuming a breakeven year for Logal in 1997 with the company expected to show solid profitability in the second half of the year. For 1998 we are assuming revenues of $23.4 million with EPS expected to reach $0.41.&quot;</p>
