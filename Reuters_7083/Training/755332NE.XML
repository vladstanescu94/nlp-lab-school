<title>GERMANY: SAP to beat sales goal, helped by fx moves.</title>
<headline>SAP to beat sales goal, helped by fx moves.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-07-24</dateline>

<p>Fast-growing German software house SAP AG said on Thursday it hoped to exceed its 1997 sales growth targets, and said first half sales and profits had been boosted by the weaker deutschemark.</p>
<p>&quot;Bearing in mind the positive market environment we are optimistic of beating our sales forecast made at the beginning of the year of 25 to 30 percent growth,&quot; chief executive Dietmar Hopp said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Hopp's statement followed the publication of first half results on Wednesday which showed a 56 percent rise in pre-tax profits to 582 million marks ($319.1 million) and a 51 percent gain in sales to 2.4 billion marks.</p>
<p>Hopp said weakness in the German mark, which is near eight-year lows against the dollar, had boosted the first half pre-tax figure by 61 million marks and sales by 145 million.</p>
<p>Sales growth in the second half would be more moderate, however: &quot;Considering the high basis from last year, growth in the second half should slow down (compared to the first half),&quot; Hopp commented.</p>
<p>SAP has announced it plans to seek a listing on the U.S. stock market by the end of 1998 at the latest, and Hopp also said the company wants to carry out a share buyback as soon as it is legally possible in Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;The measures presuppose legal changes in Germany. SAP hopes that those changes will be carried out quickly to eliminate competitive disadvantages,&quot; Hopp said.</p>
