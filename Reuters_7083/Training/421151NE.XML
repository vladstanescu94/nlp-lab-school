<p>Broderbund Software Inc. stock tumbled Wednesday after the company warned that profits for the latest quarter would come in well below expectations on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Stock of the Novato, Calif.-based software company fell $7 to $23.50 in active trading on Nasdaq, where it was the second-biggest percentage loser of the session, after several brokerages cut their ratings on the stock.</p>
<p>Broderbund, which makes interactive software, has relied heavily in recent years on the Myst mystery-adventure game to boost revenues. But sales of the game began falling sharply last year as new products from competitors came to market.</p>
<p>Broderbund said after the stock market closed on Tuesday that earnings for the latest quarter would be 15 to 20 cents a share, excluding one-time charges. That is well below the average forecast by analysts for 31 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.</p>
<p>Broderbund cited price-cutting that helped sales volume but hurt profit margins.</p>
<p>Lehman Brothers, Alex. Brown &amp; Sons and Morgan Stanley all cut their ratings on Broderbund after the announcement.</p>
<p>&quot;The shortfall was due primarily to lower gross margins caused by aggressive price reductions,&quot; Lehman analyst Michael Stanek said in a report. He cut the stock to neutral from buy and set a 12-month price target of $30.</p>
<p>The price-cutting worked in December as it boosted sales of the software but unit sales were &quot;off significantly&quot; in January and February, he said.</p>
<p>Broderbund said earnings will also include charges related to its plan to acquire the half of educational software maker Living Books it does not already own. Terms of the deal, announced on Jan. 17, were not disclosed.</p>
<p>The company expects to report results on March 20. A year ago Broderbund reported earnings of $18.8 million, or 87 cents a share for its second fiscal quarter ended on Feb. 29, 1996. The results included a one-time gain of $15.5 million related to the termination of its agreement to merge with The Learning Co.</p>
