<title>USA: Marimba to integrate Castanet with Shockwave.</title>
<headline>Marimba to integrate Castanet with Shockwave.</headline>

<p>Marimba Inc said it and Macromedia Inc will integrate Macromedia's Shockwave multimedia technology and the Marimba Castanet Tuner to enable Castanet channels to support Shockwave features.</p>
<p>The Macromedia product provides interactivity, animations and high-quality audio content and Castanet provides more than 300,000 developers using Macromedia's Director authoring tools to distribute their content over the Internet.</p>
<p>&quot;They'll be able to take their existing content and deliver it as a channel to Castanet,&quot; Marimba president and chief executive Kim Polese told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;For Macromedia it means they have a new distribution channel for developers to deploy Shockwave, and also they can enable their developers to build Shockwave applications that are dynamically updated,&quot; Polese said.</p>
<p>Marimba's Castanet system enables software developers to update their products over the Internet with only those parts of the software which has been changed, rather than having to use up bandwidth to transmit the whole program repeatedly.</p>
<p>Initially, the capability will be delivered as a Shockwave plug-in on the Marimba Web site, but after Marimba choses an authentication partner in the next few weeks, Polese said developers will not need a plug-in to include movies directly.</p>
<p>&quot;Once we have authentication built into the product, then we can just let developers include the movies as part of the channel directly, instead of needing a plug-in,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The Shockwave platform has become one of the most popular methods for viewing dynamic multimedia on the World Wide Web since it was introduced one year ago, with more than 12 million Shockwave viewers downloaded from Macromedia's site.</p>
<p>The Castanet support for Shockwave is due in the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>Marimba is a privately held company founded in February, 1996 by four original members of Sun Microsystems Inc's Java development team.</p>
