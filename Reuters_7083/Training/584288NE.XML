<title>UK: Sage confident of second half operations.</title>

<p>British business software group Sage Group Plc said on Wednesday its second half had started well and meant it expected a satisfactory full year.</p>
<p>The group's chairman David Goldman said on Wednesday that the operating environment of Sage's customers appeared to be favourable and it offered enough opportunities of growth and improve its performance.</p>
<p>&quot;The second half has started well and I expect that the outcome for the full year will be entirely satisfactory,&quot; Goldman said.</p>
<p>Goldman's bullish forecast came as it reported a 20 percent hike in its pre-tax profits for the six months to March 31 to 19.3 million stg with its earnings per share rising to 12.03 pence from 9.92 pence in the previous year.</p>
<p>The company said its UK software firms, Sagesoft and Multisoft, had both improved turnover and margins.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision to split the Sagesoft business into primary sales and user-base sales divisions, in order to improve focus, is having the desired effect with strong growth,&quot; Goldman said.</p>
<p>He said the performance of its German KHK business, taken over in late February, had reported &quot;above average&quot; sales in its first month under Sage's ownership.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been very encouraged by our early experience of the KHK business,&quot; Goldman said.</p>
<p>Sage's turnover, however, rose during the first six months rose marginally to 73.6 million stg as currency fluctuations knocked off 5.5 million stg from its turnover and took away 1.1 million stg in pre-tax profits.</p>
