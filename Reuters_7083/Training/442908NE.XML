<title>USA: Oracle shares rise on better-than-expected profit.</title>

<p>Oracle Corp. shares rose 13 percent Friday after the database software company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that matched Wall Street expectations and eased concerns about the company's outlook in coming months.</p>
<p>Shares of Oracle, the second-largest software company after Microsoft Corp., jumped $4.875 to $41 on Nasdaq, where it was the second-most active stock on volume of 17.3 million shares.</p>
<p>After the market closed on Thursday, Oracle, based in Redwood Shores, Calif., said profit from operations rose to $193 million, or 29 cents a share, matching analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>More importantly, Oracle said revenue in Europe -- a weak spot for the past few quarters -- rose 28 percent in the quarter, better than analysts expected.</p>
<p>&quot;Their business is going strong again on all fronts,&quot; said Bruce Raabe, at brokerage Collins &amp; Co. in San Francisco. &quot;There's still certainly lots of demand for Oracle products in Europe.&quot;</p>
<p>Oracle has been reshaping its European operations to adjust to weaker economic conditions there. The effort is paying off, company executives told analysts on Thursday.</p>
<p>Oracle also said it was on track to deliver a new version of its flagship database product by June. Once the new programme, Oracle8, is introduced, customers would likely buy it &quot;fairly aggressively,&quot; Raabe said.</p>
<p>At least one closely watched Wall Street analyst, Drew Brosseau of Cowen &amp; Co., upgraded his rating on Oracle's stock, based on the strong performance in the quarter.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Oracle shares have slid because of concerns about the company's European performance and possible delays in the shipment of Oracle8.</p>
