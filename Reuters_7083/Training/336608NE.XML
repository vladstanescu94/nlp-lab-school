<headline>System Software named in second lawsuit.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>A law firm representing shareholders of System Software Associates Inc said Tuesday it filed a class action lawsuit against the company for allegedly misrepresenting material information about revenues and earnings.</p>
<p>The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, is the second class action lawsuit filed against the company in the past week. It was filed on behalf of shareholders of the company between August 22, 1994 and January 7, 1997.</p>
<p>On January 22, a similar suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for Illinois, Eastern Division, claiming the company misrepresented its earnings. Named in that suit were four company officials, including the company's chief executive Roger Covey.</p>
<p>Covey was also named in Tuesday's suit, which was filed by the law firm of Pomerantz, Haudek, Block &amp; Grossman.</p>
<p>On January 7, the company said it would restate its financial results for the fiscal years 1994 and 1995 due to errors in its accounting procedures, according to plaintiffs' lawyers.</p>
<p>The lawyers said the company estimated the reversal of improperly recognized revenue would exceed $30 million.</p>
<p>The company said on January 14 that both lawsuits have no merit.</p>
<p>Shares of the company were unchanged in late trading Tuesday at 10-1/4.</p>
