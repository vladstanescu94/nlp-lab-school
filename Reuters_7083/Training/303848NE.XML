<headline>AOL top web site, Microsoft gains-PC Meter.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>America Online had the most popular site on the Internet's World Wide Web for the three months ended Oct 31, but Microsoft Corp's site is gaining fast, according to a report by PC-Meter.</p>
<p>Over 40 percent of the 10,000 households tracked by the market research firm, up half a percent from the previous quarter, visited the AOL site, making it the most popular on the web.</p>
<p>Microsoft's site garnered visits from only about 21 percent of the households but that was up almost seven percent from the previous quarter and up 13 percent over the last six months.  </p>
<p>Yahoo, the vast directory of Internet sites that also provides news and weather, ranked second overall for the quarter, PC-Meter said. Almost 39 percent of households visited the site, a gain of half a percent from the previous quarter.</p>
<p>The site run by Netscape Communications Corp dropped off slightly during the quarter, PC-Meter noted.</p>
<p>Over 38 percent of households visited Netscape's site, good enough to rank as third most popular but reflecting a loss of almost three percent from the previous quarter when it ranked first overall.  </p>
<p>Other sites that compete with Yahoo to provide listings of Internet sites helped round out the top 10 for the quarter.</p>
<p>Webcrawler ranked fourth with almost 31 percent of households visiting. The site was sold in November by AOL to Excite. Excite's own search site ranked seventh for the quarter, Infoseek Corp ranked sixth, and Lycos ranked eighth. PC-Meter did not provide specific percentages of visitors for those sites.</p>
<p>In addition to Microsoft, which ranked fifth overall, Geocities filled out the top ranks, finishing 10th for the quarter, PC-Meter said.  </p>
<p>The site allows people to post their own homepage for free.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T Corp's fledgling Internet service propeled its web site into the top 25 for the first time, landing at number 20 for the quarter, PC-Meter said.</p>
<p>The demographic make-up of web surfers remained fairly static during the quarter, PC-Meter said. The audience was composed of 56 percent adult men, 32 percent adult women and 12 percent children under age 18.</p>
