<headline>UK bill to fight millennium computer bug fails.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>A bill aimed at averting the risk of computers being unable to cope with the dawn of the new millennium was blocked in parliament on Friday.</p>
<p>Junior trade and industry minister Ian Taylor, arguing that the bill would impose unwanted burdens on business, effectively killed the measure by ensuring he was still talking when time ran out at the end of a brief debate.</p>
<p>The bill now goes to the back of a long queue for debate if time allows, which its disappointed author, Conservative legislator David Atkinson, admitted was highly unlikely.</p>
<p>&quot;This represents a huge missed opportunity for the government to clearly show that it takes this problem seriously, and to provide a means by which the owners of companies can discover what their directors are doing to tackle the problem,&quot; Atkinson, who had support for his bill from a number of leading companies, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The bill would have required British companies to assess and publish details of their readiness to adapt their computer systems to deal with calendar dates after December 31, 1999.</p>
<p>Industry experts have warned of possible &quot;Millennium Meltdown&quot; chaos because the year in most computer programmes is expressed as a double digit -- currently 97.</p>
<p>Taylor acknowledged the risk that, unless properly programmed, computers would be flummoxed by a double-zero for 2000 and would go haywire.</p>
<p>But he said the right approach was to make firms aware of the gravity of the issue rather than to impose new laws.</p>
<p>Some big companies were already gearing up. U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley Inc was spending 55 million pounds ($89.57 million) and employing an extra 200 staff to tackle the issue, he said.</p>
<p>But Atkinson said the government's support to date for its Taskforce 2000, set up to address the problem, was &quot;pathetic&quot;.</p>
<p>He said: &quot;I look to the government to put its money where its mouth is, and give the issue the priority and resources it deserves.&quot; ($1=.6140 Pound)</p>
