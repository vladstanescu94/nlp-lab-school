<title>USA: Networking stocks lead tech decline.</title>
<headline>Networking stocks lead tech decline.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Technology stocks' abuse continued Wednesday, with networking companies leading the decline amid reports of slowing Internet equipment sales, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Cisco and the like opened down on comments of Internet sales slowing down,&quot; said said Jack Bayer, managing director and head of over-the-counter trading at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</p>
<p>The selloff in technology issues &quot;is a continuing trend here, with even the big ones like Intel starting to go now,&quot; Bayer said.  Intel Corp lost 3-3/8 to 133-3/8.  </p>
<p>Analysts said executives from Cisco Systems Inc and 3Com Corp made comments at separate industry conferences suggesting that Internet equipment sales have slowed in the United States.  Cisco and 3Com could not be reached.</p>
<p>Those comments rocked networking stocks, sending Cisco down 2-3/8 to 48 and Ascend Communications Inc off 5-5/8 to 42-1/2 in heavy trading.</p>
<p>But analysts said the scare was overblown.  </p>
<p>&quot;Ascend has a huge backlog right now,&quot; said Chris Stix, an analyst with Cowen &amp; Co.  Stix said the market &quot;very much&quot; overreacted to the sales warning.</p>
<p>Hambrecht &amp; Quist analyst Joe Noel said in a research report that although there is some evidence that growth may be slowing, the recent selloff in networking and telecom equipment has been &quot;overly severe and far too widespread among the companies in the group.&quot;</p>
<p>Noel said the networking sector is fundamentally healthy.  </p>
<p>Companies such as Ascend, PairGain Technologies Inc and Tellabs Inc have seen strong sales in the March quarter and could beat Wall Street earnings estimates, Noel said.</p>
<p>International markets will serve as a major source of growth for the networking industry, but some companies such as Cisco have seen weakness in certain markets such as France, Germany and Italy, Noel said.</p>
<p>Some product transitions may also hinder's Cisco's near-term performance, analysts said.  </p>
<p>U.S. Robotics Corp dropped 4-5/16 to 52-7/16 and 3Com shed 2-3/4 to 31.  U.S. Robotics said Tuesday it had been named as defendant in six lawsuits related to its proposed merger with 3Com.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange networking index dropped 12.10 to 226.10 at midday. The Nasdaq composite index lost 26.85 to 1242.49, falling below its 1997 opening levels. Nasdaq shares have lost ground in seven out of the past eight sessions.  </p>
<p>Other technology issues suffered Wednesday, with chip stocks off sharply.  Texas Instruments Inc dropped 3-1/2 to 76-1/2.  Advanced Micro Devices Inc lost 4-1/4 to 37-5/8 and Micron Technology Inc slipped 2-3/8 to 37-3/8.  Semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials Inc fell 3-11/16 to 44-3/8.</p>
<p>Other casualties of the technology bloodbath included Microsoft Corp, off 4-1/2 to 95-1/8, and Dell Computer Corp, down four to 60.</p>
<p>Adobe Systems Inc was one of the few bright spots in the technology sector. The graphics-editing software company's stock rallied 3-3/8 to 38-1/4 after its first quarter earnings, released Tuesday, surpassed analysts' expectations. Some brokerage firms upgraded the stock.</p>
