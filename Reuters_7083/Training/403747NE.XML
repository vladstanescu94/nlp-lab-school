<title>UK: UK bill to fight millennium computer bug advances.</title>
<headline>UK bill to fight millennium computer bug advances.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-26</dateline>

<p>A bill aimed at averting the risk of computers being unable to cope with the dawn of the new millennium cleared its committee stage in the British parliament on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The bill will now go before the full House of Commons on Friday, but, with the government opposed to the measure, the odds are that it will not become law.</p>
<p>Conservative member of parliament David Atkinson's bill would require British companies to assess and publish details of their readiness to adapt their computer systems to deal with calendar dates after December 31, 1999.</p>
<p>Industry experts have warned of possible &quot;Millennium Bug&quot; chaos because the year in most computer programmes is expressed as a double digit -- currently 97.</p>
<p>The risk is that, unless properly programmed, computers will be flummoxed by a double-zero for 2000 and will go haywire.</p>
<p>Atkinson said several amendments were accepted when the bill was scrutinised in committee following suggestions made by leading British firms, many of which have lent their support to the bill.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's obviously a better bill for those amendments and I just hope now that the government will see the sense of my bill and will support it on Friday,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said ministers had confirmed their opposition to the bill, arguing it constituted an unnecessary burden on business.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Atkinson said he remained optimistic. &quot;There's still time between now and Friday to encourage common sense to prevail,&quot; he said.</p>
