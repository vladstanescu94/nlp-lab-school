<p>Oracle Corp. said Thursday that profit from operations for its fiscal third quarter rose 32 percent on strong sales of its database software.</p>
<p>Oracle, the second biggest software company after Microsoft Corp., also said a new version of its flagship product, Oracle8, is entering the final stages of testing and is scheduled to ship in June.</p>
<p>Net income for the quarter ended Feb. 28 rose to $193 million, or 29 cents a share, from $146 million, or 22 cents, in the same quarter a year ago. With a $37 million charge for the acquisition of another software company, Oracle had net income of $169.3 million, or 25 cents, in the latest quarter.</p>
<p>Wall Street expected Oracle, based in Redwood Shores, Calif., to report profit from operations of 29 cents a share, according to a recent analyst survey by First Call.</p>
<p>Third-quarter revenue rose 29 percent to $681.1 million from $528.4 million.</p>
<p>Oracle writes computer programmes that let companies store and retrieve huge amounts of vital corporate information. In recent quarters, the company has had slowing revenue growth because of weak sales abroad, particularly in Europe.</p>
<p>Some customers also have put off purchases to wait for the release of the new version of its flagship product.</p>
<p>Oracle said a test version of Oracle8 has been shipped to test sites and the company is on schedule to ship a final version by June.</p>
<p>The company said revenue from sales of its core programmes rose 29 percent in the quarter compared with a year ago.</p>
<p>The company also writes specialised financial and human resources software that taps a customer's database. Revenue from that business rose 61 percent in the quarter, Oracle said.</p>
<p>Oracle's results were released after stock markets closed. Its stock climbed $2 to $36.125 on Nasdaq on Thursday.</p>
