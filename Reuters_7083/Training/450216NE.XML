<p>Adobe Systems Inc said its fiscal first-quarter profit from operations rose 35 percent, much better than Wall Street expected, on strong sales of its graphics editing software.</p>
<p>The California based Adobe also said it will pay investors a dividend from time to time based on the profit made from selling stakes it owns in other public companies. Adobe runs a venture capital operation that has invested in many new Silicon Valley companies, including Netscape Communications Corp.</p>
<p>For the quarter ended Feb. 28, Adobe's profit from operations rose to $45.4 million, or $0.61 a share, from $32 million, or $0.42 a share.</p>
<p>Analysts expected Adobe, the third-biggest personal computer software company, to earn 51 cents a share, according to a recent survey by Zacks Investment Research.</p>
<p>With a one-time gain, the company had net income of $46.5 million, or $0.63 a share, in the most recent quarter.</p>
<p>First-quarter revenue rose 17 percent to $226.5 million from $193.6 million.</p>
<p>Adobe writes computer programs that help graphic artists design and lay out publications and to produce illustrations. Revenue from applications, aided by the release of a new version of its flagship PageMaker product, rose to $175 million from $146.7 million.</p>
<p>In recent years Adobe has invested in several startups that have gone public. To date, the company has received $72.6 million in cash from its venture capital business. The company will distribute some of the money to its investors through periodic dividends, the first of which will be paid within the next few months, Adobe said.</p>
