<title>USA: Adobe Systems shares rise on better-than-expected profits.</title>

<p>Adobe Systems Inc. shares jumped 11 percent Wednesday after the software company reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on strong sales of its graphics editing computer programmes.</p>
<p>Shares of Adobe, the nation's third-biggest personal computer software company, rose $3.75 to $38.625 on Nasdaq trading of almost 7.1 million shares.</p>
<p>After the market closed Tuesday, Adobe said profits from operations for the quarter ended Feb. 28 rose 35 percent to $45.4 million, or 61 cents a share. Wall Street had expected Adobe to earn 51 cents a share, according to a recent survey by Zacks Investment Research.</p>
<p>First-quarter revenue rose 17 percent to $226.5 million, the San Jose, Calif.-based company said.</p>
<p>Adobe writes computer programmes that help graphic artists design publications and make illustrations. Much of the strong sales during the quarter came from a new version of PageMaker, a page layout programme, the company said.</p>
<p>The company also has &quot;good fundamental demand&quot; for PhotoShop, a digital photo-enhancement programme, said Mike Wallace, an analyst at UBS Securities in New York.</p>
<p>&quot;They're in the middle of upgrading all of their major products,&quot; Wallace said. Aggressive cost control also helped Adobe improve its gross margins -- a measure of profit on every dollar of product sold -- by three points to 85 percent, he said.</p>
<p>Adobe also runs a venture capital operation that invests in Silicon Valley startups. Adobe said Tuesday that it plans to pay a dividend based on the profit it makes from investments in other companies.</p>
<p>Based on the better-than-expected earnings, at least four Wall Street analysts raised their rating on Adobe's stock or boosted their earnings forecast for the year.</p>
