<p>Soundcard maker Creative Technology Ltd is aiming 10-15 percent revenue growth for the financial year ending June 1988, the Business Times newspaper said on Monday.</p>
<p>It said the company also expected gross margins of 30 percent for the next five quarters.</p>
<p>On Friday, Creative reported net profits of US$44.24 million for the third quarter ended March 31, 1997 against a loss of US$33.12 million in the same period a year earlier. It chalked up sales of US$282.82 million, marginally higher than the previous year's quarter of US$282.06 million.  </p>
<p>The newspaper said Creative's expectations were based on its latest Sound Blaster card called the AWE64 Value and its digital video disk (DVD) drives.</p>
<p>&quot;Our strategy in terms of top-line growth hinges on DVD. In terms of margin growth, its the AWE64,&quot; it quoted Creative chief executive Sim Wong Hoo as saying.</p>
<p>In the next few weeks, Creative will launch the AWE64 Value card at US$99, much lower than the price of its current AWE64 card which costs US$199. The cards allow the playing of 64 instruments simultaneously.  </p>
<p>The AWE64 Value is aimed at replacing the older US$99 16-bit sound card, which make up the bulk of Creative's sound card sales, the paper said.</p>
<p>The Value line of the AWE64 is much cheaper because of tight cost controls. It will be bundled with less software and have slightly fewer features than the regular AWE64 product.</p>
<p>Creative hopes its new DVD drives will boost revenues.</p>
<p>It started shipping the first generation of these drives a month ago and has been well-received at a low price of US$499, the company said. An improved, lower-cost version is due to ship this summer, Creative said.  </p>
<p>About 60 percent of Creative's sales now come from its core audio business, 30 percent from multimedia upgrade kits and the rest from other products like DVD and Internet produtcs.</p>
