<headline>Netscape unveils Visual JavaScript tool.</headline>
<dateline>MOUNTAIN VIEW, California 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>Netscape Communications Corp said on Tuesday it was releasing an early test version of a visual programming tool customers can use to write applications for communicating using Internet technology without having to write software code.</p>
<p>The Netscape Visual JavaScript software, which was previously called Palomar, lets developers at large organisations develop a new category of &quot;crossware&quot; applications that enables developers to use a pointing device such as a mouse to &quot;drag and drop&quot; in key components.</p>
<p>The modular software framework, increasingly popular in the development community because it enables the broad re-use of software coding, supports software components written in Java, JavaScript and HTML.</p>
<p>Java is a computer language developed by Sun Microsystems Inc that enables software based on it to run across a variety of computer platforms that would otherwise be incompatible.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a scripting language based on Java, and HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, the basic software structure used in setting up Web pages.  </p>
<p>Netscape said a preview release was already being made available to certain leading-edge developers in its DevEdge program, with broader availability of the scaled-down initial version of the software available next week.</p>
<p>The software is aimed at a new category that Netscape has dubbed &quot;crossware&quot; because it can be used on both internal corporate networks using Web technology known as Intranets, and on Internet-standard connections between institutions which are now termed Extranets.</p>
<p>Rick Fleischman, Netscape's group product manager for tools, said the final version of Netscape Visual JavaScript should be available early in the fourth quarter of 1997, with an expected price of $495.</p>
<p>The first versions will be available for Microsoft Corp's Windows and Windows NT operating systems, but will eventually be extended to all the computer systems Netscape supports, including Apple Computer Inc's Macintosh and various Unix varieties.</p>
<p>Netscape also said it expects to begin shipping its Netscape Enterprise Server 3.0 Pro on both Unix and Windows NT operating systems in the second quarter of 1997 with an expected price of $1,995.  </p>
<p>The new addition to Netscape's Web server products includes its LiveWire database connectivity and the choice of a development and limited deployment copy of Informix workgroup server software or a development-only copy of Oracle Corp's Oracle7 server database.</p>
<p>Netscape said Visual JavaScript will also complement products from NetDynamics, NetObjects and Symantec, which are part of Netscape's SuiteTools cluster.</p>
