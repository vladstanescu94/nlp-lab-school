<p>Infoseek CEO Robin Johnson said the company expects the number of page views it provides a day will increase to 11 million next month from around 8 million currently.</p>
<p>The increase will result from the company's deal with Netscape Communications Corp in which Infoseek is due to receive at least 35 percent of the traffic that goes through Netscape's Net Search button, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're thinking we'll be up around 11 (million) pretty quickly,&quot; Johnson said in an interview after the company posted its first quarter results. &quot;We still have to go and sell it. We continue to be on track,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier, Infoseek reported a net loss in the first quarter of $4.1 million, or $0.16 a share, compared with a net loss of $3.6 million, or $0.14 a share, a year ago.</p>
<p>Wall Street had been expecting the company, which went public last June, to post a loss of $0.15 a share, according to consensus estimates calculated by First Call.</p>
<p>The company's revenues rose by more than 2.5 times to $6.1 million from $1.7 million in the 1996 first quarter.</p>
<p>The results were released after Thursday's market close.</p>
<p>Infoseek closed down 3/8 at 60-3/4 in Nasdaq trade.</p>
<p>Johnson said Infoseek ended the first quarter with about 7.5 million page views a day, around one quarter of the 30 million daily page views rival Yahoo! Inc reported in March and around half that of Excite.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Johnson noted Infoseek continues to generate higher click-through levels - the percentage of individuals who actually click on an advertisement to find out more about the advertiser.</p>
<p>Johnson said these have risen as high as 4 percent for Infoseek, and were around 3.5 percent towards the end of the last quarter, compared with around 1.6 percent for the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been saying for a while, all advertising availabilities are not created equal,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Infoseek reported average advertising revenue per 1,000 impressions, or cost per thousand (CPM) at around $21, above the $18 reported by Excite, for example, and he expects this could double for advertisements sold for its recently announced push delivery pages.</p>
<p>Ultimately, targeted advertising could sell for $100 or more per thousand impressions delivered to promising leads in certain markets, he added.</p>
<p>The number of advertisers on Infoseek increased six percent to 293, still less than half the number reported by Yahoo! for the latest quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we've got plenty of inventory,&quot; he said of the expected increased number of viewer traffic. (sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400)</p>
