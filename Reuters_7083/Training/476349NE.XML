<headline>INTERVIEW - Spyglass device profit seen later.</headline>

<p>Spyglass Inc said Monday its move to link devices other than personal computers to the Internet is continuing on target, but its return to profitability will likely come later than originally expected.</p>
<p>&quot;We felt '97 and '98 would be years that we would actually invest in the business, and then we believe thereafter we will return to profitability,&quot; Spyglass chief executive Doug Colbeth said in an interview.</p>
<p>Spyglass said last December it expected to post a loss in the first two quarters of its fiscal 1997, which began October 1, 1996, before returning to profitability in the second half. In January of this year, chief financial officer Gary Vilchick told analysts he saw a return to &quot;historical&quot; profitability in late 1997 or early 1998.</p>
<p>Spyglass is striving to connect a wide range of &quot;devices&quot; to the Internet -- everything from gas pumps to vending machines to cellular phones. A vending machine company, for example, would be able to keep tabs from headquarters on the stocks in all its machines. A cellphone user could check his e-mail from the car.  </p>
<p>Although the company has already announced major contracts such as a recent deal signed with Xerox Corp, the licensing revenues may take longer to come in, Spyglass said.</p>
<p>The company said it will spend about $12 million this year on research and development, up from $6.8 million in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt we have our focus 100 percent on the device market today,&quot; Colbeth said.</p>
<p>The company said its profitability projections may be conservative, but as the market is young it is still difficult to identify when licensing revenues will begin to come in.</p>
<p>Colbeth declined to comment on analysts' specific estimates. According to First Call, the consensus estimate for Spyglass's fiscal 1997 is a loss of $0.15 a share, and for fiscal 1998 a loss of $0.16 a share. The company reported a profit of $0.27 a share for fiscal 1996 ended September 30.</p>
<p>&quot;It really feels like things are progressing along like what we said in October, and we don't see any tremendous variance off that, but remember, this is a very new market,&quot; Colbeth said at the Spyglass headquarters in Naperville, outside of Chicago.  </p>
<p>Spyglass has three main business categories -- connectivity products, infrastructure and professional services -- and various new products were recently launched.</p>
<p>Spyglass said its professional services division, which makes the software work on a customer's particular device,is expected to account for 30 percent of its business.</p>
<p>The division already makes up 20 percent after two quarters in existence.</p>
<p>Colbeth said Spyglass is the leader in embedded technology but keeps a close eye on the rear-view mirror, especially on Microsoft Corp and Cisco Systems Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;We do believe there will be 10 or 15 companies starting up, and we have tremendous respect for that,&quot; Colbeth said. &quot;What we focus on more is what is Microsoft doing, what is Cisco doing, because they want to build the infrastructure as well.&quot;  </p>
<p>Nonetheless, Colbeth said he is convinced companies will continue to connect everything using Internet technology, as it is much more cost-effective to maintain information and systems using one format.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't ever worry that 10 years from now we'll look back and there are no devices connected,&quot; Colbeth said. &quot;They will be connected, and I just want to make sure it's our technology inside and I want to make sure the infrastructure is strong enough for devices.&quot;</p>
