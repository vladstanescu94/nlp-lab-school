<title>JAPAN: Canon to pull out of PC making and NeXT.</title>

<p>Canon Inc. said Monday it was pulling out of personal computer manufacture and selling its 20 percent stake in NeXT Software Inc., which is being acquired by Apple Computer Inc.</p>
<p>The Japanese company, a major maker of photocopiers and printers, said the realignment of its computer-related business would also include a move into production of wafers for computer chips.</p>
<p>Faced with stiff competition from bigger players in the PC business, Canon said it would transfer the running of its personal computer operations to its sales subsidiary and have Taiwanese manufacturers make Canon-brand computers.</p>
<p>Canon, which entered the computer business in the 1970s, would thus cease to produce PCs.</p>
<p>The stake in NeXT Software will be sold to Apple for cash and will not be exchanged for Apple shares, the Canon spokesman said. NeXT Software is led by Apple co-founder Steven Jobs.</p>
<p>Apple announced last month that it would rehire Jobs as a technology adviser and acquire NeXT Software for $400 million in a strategy to boost the Apple brand and win back market share from powerful rivals such as Microsoft Corp.</p>
<p>The company said it would enter the market for next-generation semiconductor wafers in mid-1997. The silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers allow chips to operate with twice the speed of conventional types and use only one-tenth the power, a Canon spokesman said.</p>
<p>The company plans to start sample shipments of its new SOI wafers to major chip makers next summer after investing around 3 billion yen ($25.8 million) to build a clean room for wafer production at its plant in Hiratsuka, south of Tokyo, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The company has not yet decided when it will start mass-producing the SOI wafer, but hopes to see annual sales of about 100 billion yen ($862 million) by 2000 from the new enterprise, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Canon's personal computer business will be transferred to its Canon Sales Co. Inc. subsidiary, which already handles the marketing of Canon's Innova line of PCs. Canon Sales plans to ask several Taiwan PC makers, including Acer Inc., to produce the PCs, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Canon said the changes would not have much impact on earnings because its computer business is a relatively small part of its overall operations. Canon made its name in cameras but has diversified into computer printers and various types of communications equipment that supply around half its sales.</p>
<p>Canon Sales said it sold about five billion yen ($43.1 million) worth of PCs last year.</p>
