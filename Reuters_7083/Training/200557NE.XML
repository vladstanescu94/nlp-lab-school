<p>Hewlett-Packard Co said on Monday that its margins would remain under pressure in the current quarter.</p>
<p>Still, the company aims for operating margins of 10 percent to 12 percent in its first fiscal quarter, compared with 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter. To reach that goal, it said it would use expense controls to counter any unexpected revenue shortfall.</p>
<p>The computer maker earlier reported a 4.0 percent decline in fourth-quarter earnings to $0.62 a share, on lower-than-expected revenues.  </p>
<p>&quot;The severity of the slowdown was unanticipated,&quot; Chief Financial Officer Bob Wayman said during a conference call.  </p>
<p>To be sure, there were some brights spots in the fourth quarter, Wayland said.. Most notably, orders grew 15 percent from the year-earlier period, compared with a 8 percent rise in the third quarter.</p>
<p>In addition, inventories of printers -- one of the company's main businesses -- stabilized after bloating in the third quarter, he said. &quot;Inkjet printer orders should be strong in the fourth quarter,&quot; the CFO officer said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, workstation sales fell in the fourth quarter and H-P was considering a restructuring of that business.  </p>
<p>Wayman said the lower workstation revenues reflected customers evaluating rival products, particularly systems built with Microsoft Corp's operating system.</p>
<p>Overall, however, H-P's computer business did better than its semiconductor equipment, test and measurement equipment and chemical products businesses.</p>
<p>Wayman said H-P may announce a further restructuring that could save about $30 million a year.</p>
<p>Analyst David Wu of Chicago Corp said: &quot;The numbers were not good. Neither the earnings nor the orders were good.&quot;</p>
