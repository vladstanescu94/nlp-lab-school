<p>Shares of Engineering Animation Inc. (EAI) soared to new 52-week intraday highs on Thursday after Hewlett-Packard Co. announced it as a partner in a new 3-D graphics programming technology.</p>
<p>Shares of the company jumped to a 52-week intraday high of 31-1/4 before easing off their peak to close at 29, up one.</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard said EAI had co-developed DirectModel with HP as a cross-platform set of programming tools which it said can create boost performance by up to 100 times over current levels while rendering and interacting with 3-D databases.</p>
<p>HP also announced a deal with Microsoft Corp. to license the technology, called DirectModel, to be integrated with Microsoft's DirectX, opening the technology up for use on a wide variety of desktop and laptop computers.</p>
<p>EAI CEO Matthew Rizai said in an interview with Reuters ahead of the announcement that his company would make use of the technology in its own applications. The company provides product visualization and digital prototyping software.</p>
<p>&quot;We're getting a lot of accounts,&quot; based on the collaboration, he said, adding that he expects the number of new &quot;seats&quot; represented by licenses from the company to double or triple annually &quot;for the next couple or three years.&quot;</p>
<p>EAI has posted five quarters of record sales and profits since going public in February of 1996, he said, adding he was comfortable with analyst's current estimates for 1997 of around $0.80 a share. This would be up from $0.36 a share in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;We're comfortable with that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're working with about six to eight automotive companies right now. This was really the area that we excelled at,&quot; he said. EAI role in developing DirectModel was part of its Million Part Initiative, aimed at enabling customers to display in real time major design projects, such as entire vehicles.</p>
