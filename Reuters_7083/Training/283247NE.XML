<p>A warning about weak Christmas sales from personal computer retailer CompUSA Inc. Thursday raised concerns that the entire computer industry may have a weak fourth quarter, sending PC stocks lower.</p>
<p>CompUSA, tradionally one of the healthier PC retailers, said it expected a disappointingly small rise in sales in the fourth quarter because of weak PC sales. The Dallas-based company was the third major PC retailer in two weeks to report a weak outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;This is certainly not a good sign,&quot; said Scott Miller, an analyst at market researcher Dataquest Inc. in San Jose, Calif.</p>
<p>Stock in Compaq Computer Corp., the world's biggest PC maker, fell $2 to $72.375. Dell Computer Corp. slipped $1.875 to $51.25. And Intel Corp., the biggest maker of PC microprocessors, declined 56.25 cents to $130.375.</p>
<p>Analysts said PC companies that make machines geared toward home users, including Packard Bell NEC Inc. and Acer Inc., did have a disappointing year.</p>
<p>Unlike last year, when Microsoft Corp. released the Windows 95 operating system, there were no compelling new technologies in 1996 to drive consumers to stores.</p>
<p>But investors may be overreacting, analysts said. The three biggest personal computer makers -- Compaq, International Business Machines Corp. and Dell -- get only a sliver of their revenues from sales to consumers.</p>
<p>In fact, each of the big three is expected to have solid fourth-quarter financial results because of strong corporate sales.</p>
<p>&quot;Our checks with distributors indicate that IBM is going to have over 30 percent growth (in its PC business) this quarter,&quot; said Gary Helmig, an analyst at brokerage SoundView Financial. &quot;IBM's sales are not really focused in the consumer marketplace.&quot;</p>
<p>SoundView Thursday raised its rating on IBM to long-term buy from hold.</p>
<p>Neither Dell nor Compaq are expected to suffer from weak consumer sales in the fourth quarter, either, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Corporate sales are still strong, as far as I can see,&quot; Dataquest's Miller said. In the past couple of months, many big companies began buying huge numbers of PCs to take advantage of new business software from Microsoft, released late this year.</p>
<p>&quot;The companies that are really suffering now are the ones that are very exposed to retail,&quot; said Don Young, an analyst at Prudential Securities in New York.</p>
<p>Those companies may continue to have weak sales increases into 1997, while consumers wait for new multimedia PCs to be released, analysts said.</p>
<p>Packard Bell and Acer officials could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
