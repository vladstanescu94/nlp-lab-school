<p>Executives from The Learning Co told analysts at a Thursday evening conference call that the company may consider buying back some of its stock.</p>
<p>When asked if a stock buyback was being considered -- the share price closed at 10-7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange at nearly five times its projected 1997 earnings -- R. Scott Murray, chief financial officer of the Cambridge-based educational software giant replied, &quot;That is an issue that I'm sure the board will consider at some point in the near future.&quot;  </p>
<p>First Call Corp's survey of analysts reveals earnings per share expectations of between $1.84 and $2.25 for 1997. The Learning Company reported cash on hand of $110.1 million.</p>
<p>Learning Co President Kevin O'Leary also told the analysts the company would be introducing a line of six branded educational titles that will retail for between $17.99 and $19.95 in the first quarter of 1997. At this price, he expects the titles to be very high volume and impulse sale items.</p>
<p>It will be a new price point for the company, he said, noting its average title retails for about $40.</p>
<p>The Learning Company, Inc develops and markets a family of educational and reference software products that sold through retail outlets, catalogue, on-line and come packaged with home computers.</p>
<p>On-line revenues were &quot;very light&quot; O'Leary said, noting most of the stream came from subscription services to schools and on-line services like America OnLine and Compuserve. &quot;But we have more on-line products coming.&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The firm has also expanded its presence in Walmart stores with the huge retailer now carrying 30 titles up from 11 a few months ago. &quot;I think you can assume we're going to be growing that area,&quot; O'Leary said.</p>
