<p>Software sales in China were worth 9.0 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) in 1996, up 32 percent from 6.8 billion yuan the year before, the China Daily said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Imported software accounted for around 57 percent of last year's sales, with most operating systems and database software coming from abroad, the newspaper quoted the Centre of Computer and Microelectronics Industry Development Research as saying.</p>
<p>A lack of support and guidance from the government was partly responsible for the problems facing the domestic software industry, which was dominated by small firms, the newspaper quoted experts as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;The government invested little in this sector and levied a 17 percent value-added tax,&quot; it quoted an official of the Minstry of Electronics Industry as saying but gave no details.</p>
<p>However, local companies dominated the financial and educational software markets in China, it said.</p>
<p>Beijing-based Userfriend Software Co, China's largest financial software manufacturer, had accounted for 40 percent of the domestic market in such products in 1996, earning 70 million yuan in sales, it said but did not elaborate.</p>
