<headline>Bail for Avant! officials set at $100,000.</headline>

<p>Bail was set at $100,000 each for top executives at Avant! Corp who face felony charges for allegedly stealing Cadence Design Systems Inc technology, a prosecutor said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Santa Clara County, Calif., Deputy District Attorney Julius Finkelstein said arrest warrants were issued for all of the defendants and bail was set at $100,000 each.</p>
<p>Finkelstein said he expected the top Avant! executives to surrender for booking later Tuesday.  &quot;I anticipate they will be posting bail,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>On Monday, the district attorney's office alleged that Avant!, its president and other senior officials misappropriated Cadence's Symbad, Froute, Groute, Qplace and Vsize technologies, and &quot;then used that stolen technology to develop and market competing products.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have a major publicly-traded company that appears to be founded on stolen technology,&quot; Finkelstein said.</p>
<p>Charges of conspiracy and theft of trade secrets were filed against Avant! president and director Gerald Hsu, vice president of engineering Stephen Tzyh-Lih Wuu, vice president of technology Yuh-Zen Liao and director Yun-Chung Eric Cho.  </p>
<p>The charges were also filed against Avant! employee Chih-Liang Eric Cheng; director of business operations Shiaoli Leigh Huang; and Mitsuru Igusa, according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>All of the officials charged were former employees of Cadence Design Systems.</p>
<p>Avant! and Cadence have been bitter rivals for years.  They both sell software that helps engineers design the intricate layouts of computer chips.</p>
<p>For more than a year, Cadence has been pressing its own civil action against Avant!, alleging its rival stole some of its programming codes and used them in its own products.</p>
