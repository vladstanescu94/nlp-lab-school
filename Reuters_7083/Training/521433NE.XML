<title>UK: Microsoft enlivens U.S. shares in London.</title>
<headline>Microsoft enlivens U.S. shares in London.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares in Micrsosoft Corp were the standout feature in London trading of U.S. stocks on Friday after the software giant posted better-than-expected earnings after the New York close on Thursday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Microsoft shares were trading up at $103-1/4 by 1015 GMT, up from $100 in after-hours trading and up $5-1/8 from their New York close, and dragging other technology stocks higher in their wake.</p>
<p>&quot;Microsoft has certainly lit up the tech stocks,&quot; said on trader in London. &quot;Apart from that, things are pretty quiet.&quot;  </p>
<p>International Business Machines Corp was quoted up $1/2 at $137-5/8, Texas Instruments was up 1/2 at 85-1/4 and Digital Equipment Corp was up $1/2 at 27-3/4.</p>
<p>Microsoft posted a jump in earnings per share to $0.79, up from $0.44 a year before and well above the $0.64 analysts had pencilled in. It said revenues from platform products such as the Windows operating system rose 73 percent to $1.68 billion.  </p>
<p>However dealers here pointed to the cautious tone of the company's statement, saying the market's knee-jerk reaction to the headline earnings figures may prove short-lived.</p>
<p>&quot;The statement was a bit cautious so we will have to see if it lasts,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In an interview, Microsoft chief financial officer Mike Brown said he expected fourth-quarter earnings to be similar to those in the third quarter, which he said had been &quot;sizzling.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown said he expected growth to slow over the next five quarters but to rise after that.  </p>
<p>Elsewhere, trading in U.S. stocks was mixed after Thursday's 21.27 point drop in the Dow, its first lower close for four sessions.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T Corp, due to report first-quarter results on Monday April 21, was unchanged at $33-3/4 after British Telecommunications Plc and its U.S. partner MCI Communications confirmed Spain's Telefonica would join its Concert alliance at the expense of AT&amp;T's Unisource.</p>
<p>Dealers said the announcement had been expected and had no immediate impact on AT&amp;T shares.  </p>
<p>The June futures contract on the S&amp;P 500 index was trading up 2.40 points at 768.40, pointing to a firm start on the Dow, while T-bonds were little changed, with the benchmark 30-year issue down 1/32 at 94-16.</p>
<p>Brokerage UBS said in a research note on Friday the Dow -- which touched a three-month low of 6,356.7 on April 14 -- was &quot;extremely oversold&quot; and with pension funds pouring in by the April 15 deadline, &quot;these two forces should join hands to produce a rally in (in the Dow) to the 6,800 area in the near term.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;Strong volume and breadth on this advance would indicate strong demand for equities at current levels, and the likelihood that the worst of the correction is over,&quot; UBS said.</p>
<p>But it added: &quot;If the market cannot generate such demand, the odds of another downleg are high.&quot;</p>
