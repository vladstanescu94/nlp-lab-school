<title>USA: US OPTIONS FOCUS/IBM, Iomega and gold stocks.</title>
<headline>US OPTIONS FOCUS/IBM, Iomega and gold stocks.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-07-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Call options on International Business Machines Corp were heavily traded as IBM shares were among the few to gain on Friday amid a broad market selloff, traders said.</p>
<p>IBM July 100 calls, August 105 calls and August 110 calls were the busiest options on the Chicago Board Options Exchange as the stock rose more than 4 points to about 104 despite a 100-point fall in the Dow Jones Industrials .DJI.</p>
<p>Similarly, Iomega Corp calls were also near the top of the most-actives list at CBOE and the American Stock Exchange as the stock gained more than 2 to above 24.  </p>
<p>A brokerage firm trader said strong buying interest was boosting volume in those options.</p>
<p>However, many traders were not very optimistic about a sustained rally in those shares.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the tech stocks in general are done for,&quot; said Bill Yates of DYR Associates. He noted that IBM had been a laggard during the tech stocks' recent rally and was now just playing catch-up, while Iomega stock was always a wild card.</p>
<p>&quot;IBM was pretty much the one big stock that hadn't moved, so for some reason they're going back and picking IBM today,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Oftentimes it shows an end of a rally when they come back and pick up the stocks in the group that didn't rally previously,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Yates recommended buying puts now to lock in profit if a trader had IBM or any tech stocks which, led by Microsoft Corp, turned down today after a long bull run.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not much bottom picking to be done,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jay Shartsis, director of options trading at R.F. Lafferty &amp; Co, was also skeptical about the few buoyant tech stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;They're building in so much positive expectation,&quot; he said. &quot;At this point you can start to disappoint.&quot;  </p>
<p>IBM was due to announce its earnings on Monday. According to the research firm First Call, analysts on average expect $1.42 a share versus $1.26 a year earlier.</p>
<p>But Shartsis said meeting or exceeding such expectations did not really matter in the current over-extended market.</p>
<p>&quot;Just look at Microsoft,&quot; he said, referring to the stock's selloff despite a sharp rise in earnings reported Thursday that met expectations.</p>
<p>Gold stocks were one sector that was just basing and beginning to move upward, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold stocks -- everything else, watch out,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Shartsis said Placer Dome and Newmont Mining Corp were two of the major stocks in the sector.</p>
<p>The trouble with gold stocks for option traders was that they have low volatility, both actual and implied, Yates said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's best to sell options (primarily via buy-write against a stock position) when stocks moved down,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But incredibly, when gold went down, the stocks didn't create any high volatility,&quot; he added. &quot;So there's little volatility to sell.&quot;</p>
<p>On the other hand, slow anticipated gains meant outright call buying would be a fight against time decay, he said.</p>
