<headline>US OPTIONS FOCUS/Big three tech stocks dominate.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-07-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>The big three technology names -- Intel Corp, International Business Machines Corp and Microsoft Corp -- dominated equity options trading on Thursday ahead of Microsoft's earnings results.</p>
<p>&quot;That's probably the most business we've ever seen out of any three stocks,&quot; said Jon Najarian, president of Mercury Trading, a market-making firm at the Chicago Board Options Exchange.</p>
<p>More than 250,000 options contracts traded today in the three stocks combined.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think people were holding their breath, hoping Microsoft can do what Intel did -- that is, once again surprise the street,&quot; Najarian said, referring to Intel shares' bull run after the firm's better than expected earnings figures earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Soon after the market close, Microsoft said its fourth quarter earnings rose to $0.80 per share from $0.43 a year earlier, barely above average estimates of $0.79.</p>
<p>The figure was below some &quot;whisper numbers&quot; circulating in the market earlier, and the stock sank to 146 after the bell from a close of 149-7/16.  </p>
<p>While the market was still perceived to be on a bull trend, some traders were starting to see toppish signs for the near term.</p>
<p>Rod Jamieson, vice president of option strategies at EVEREN Securities, said the biggest orders in Microsoft options he saw were call selling and put buying.</p>
<p>&quot;Top-picking, if you want to call it that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's had a great run and expiration usually leads to positive influence,&quot; Jamieson noted. &quot;We're kind of looking for some pullback next week, especially in the techs if anything.&quot;  </p>
<p>Microsoft's July 150 calls and 145 puts had implied volatilities of about 70 and 95 percent respectively toward the close. August volatilities were at more traditional levels around 50 percent.</p>
<p>While Microsoft calls dominated the top places on the Pacific Exchange's most actives list, IBM and Intel had that distinction on CBOE and the American Stock Exchange respectively. The most heavily traded contracts for each of the big three had volume of more than 10,000 lots.</p>
<p>Michael Schwartz, a managing director of Oppenheimer and Co, said rollover out of July into August helped boost volume.  </p>
<p>&quot;(It was) last-minute rolling-over rather than closing positions and taking profits,&quot; he said. &quot;People are sticking with these technologies.&quot;</p>
<p>July equity options end trading on Friday and expire, technically, on Saturday.</p>
<p>Schwartz noted that rollovers were evident even in Microsoft, even though event risk like earnings reports usually attracted interest in shorter-dated options because of their higher gamma acceleration.</p>
<p>&quot;They don't think it's just going to be a one-day phenomenon,&quot; he said.</p>
