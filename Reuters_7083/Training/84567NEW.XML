<title>USA: Microsoft launches new financial software.</title>
<headline>Microsoft launches new financial software.</headline>
<dateline>REDMOND, Wash.</dateline>
<text>
<p>Microsoft Corp said Monday it has created a new version of Money 97, a package of personal finance software.</p>
<p>The latest version includes, for the first time, a tool to convert Intuit Inc's Quicken software data into Money data to encourage users to switch the software they use. Money 97 is being sold for $34.95.</p>
<p>Money 97 gives users access to online banking, allowing them to pay their bills electronically as well as keep track of their finances over the computer.  </p>
<p>Raikes also commented on earlier news reports that Microsoft's margin could erode as only a &quot;possibility&quot; and added later in an interview that Microsoft &quot;sees no evidence of it yet.&quot; He told the Montgomery audience that &quot;there is the possibility that over time, as our success climbs, there is some possibility of saturation&quot; of its Windows 95 product in the personal computer operating system market.</p>
<p>As reported earlier, Microsoft's fiscal 1996 10K report filed with U.S. regulators mentioned the possibility of slower sales growth in the first two quarters of this year compared with big gains in fiscal 1996, which ended June 30.  </p>
<p>It said the possible slower sales coupled with increased expenses could squeeze margins. It also mentioned the possibility that the market for Windows 95 - wide open in its fiscal 1996 year - could begin to become saturated.</p>
<p>Raikes said that so far this year &quot;our sell-through is up year over year.&quot;</p>
<p>Two other product areas Microsoft will stress this year are its Windows NT server software and its Internet browser.</p>
<p>&quot;An area that is fundamental to our success in the business market is our Windows NT server,&quot; Raikes said.</p>
<p>Raikes said that independent research firms say sales of Windows NT servers are surpassing sales of other mainstream PC network operating systems, mainly Novell Inc 's NetWare 4.1.</p>
<p>Regarding Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, he said Microsoft plans to &quot;make the browser a seamless addition to how people use the computer,&quot; with plans to integrate the browser in all of its operating systems and have built-in links to the browser in all of its applications.</p>
