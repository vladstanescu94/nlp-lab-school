<headline>Spyglass in more software licensing talks.</headline>

<p>Spyglass Inc said Wednesday it is in talks with with various industrial and commercial companies interested in using the company's software to link their products to the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>&quot;While consumer electronics applications are highly visible, significant opportunities exist for us on the industrial and commercial side,&quot; chief executive Doug Colbeth said in a statement. &quot;We are in discussions with a number of companies in these areas who are interested in adding Web functionality to their products and services.&quot;  </p>
<p>Spyglass on Wednesday reported fiscal second quarter earnings of $0.16 a share including an $8 million one-time payment from Microsoft Corp, versus $0.06 a share last year.</p>
<p>Spyglass said it has made &quot;significant progress&quot; in entering the Internet device market. Late last year Spyglass said it was implementing a company strategy to develop software and services to help companies connect everyday devices such as cell phones and industrial equipment to the Internet.</p>
<p>Colbeth noted, however, the market is a young and needs to be cultivated.</p>
<p>&quot;We are the only company providing a comprehensive set of solutions allowing us to capture important design wins now that will pay off as our customers' products are widely deployed in the future,&quot; Colbeth said. &quot;However, in the short term this remains a very new market which is going to take time for us and our partners to develop.&quot;</p>
<p>Spyglass said Tim Krauskopf, a founder of Spyglass, has decided to leave the company as a full-time employee to pursue additional academic credentials. He will continue as a member of the board of directors.</p>
