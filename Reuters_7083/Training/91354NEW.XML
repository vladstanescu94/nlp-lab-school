<headline>INTERVIEW - Summit Medical in transition.</headline>

<p>Summit Medical Systems Inc is &quot;embarrassed and disappointed&quot; with its financial results, but is confident about its transition to a new technology platform and a new business format, said chief executive Kevin Green.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the business methodology we've laid out goes to the heart of what the industry needs and, in due course, will start to create the kind of predictability and financial performance we expect,&quot; Green told Reuters in an interview. Shares in the Minneapolis-based medical outcomes data software and systems company plunged 5-3/4 on Wednesday to 7.  </p>
<p>The share decline came after the company said its third-quarter and fourth-quarter financial results would fall short of Wall Street analysts' projections.</p>
<p>&quot;The guidance for the year is a tad better than break-even,&quot; Green said. The company expects a loss of $0.03 to $0.05 per share for the third quarter and a profit of $0.07 to $0.08 per share for the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>On the top line, Summit projects third-quarter revenues of between $4.05 million and $4.1 million and fourth-quarter revenues of about $6.5 million. The 1996 revenue projection is $19.5 million and 1997's is $27 to $28 million.  </p>
<p>Summit sells computer systems to medical specialists for tracking medical outcomes data.</p>
<p>Over the next 90 days, it is introducing Keystone, &quot;a next generation product not in lieu of, but in addition to our procedural-based product,&quot; Green said.</p>
<p>In addition, he said: &quot;We have a new methodology of how to do business that we've introduced in concert.&quot;</p>
<p>Rather than continuing to license its systems perpetually, Summit is beginning to sign three-year licensing deal that include enhanced services packages.  </p>
<p>&quot;We need to have this be a fundamental part of how we do business,&quot; Green said.</p>
<p>Summit has 1,800 clients and more than 2,700 systems installed around the world. It gets a marketing boost from its maintenance of national databases for several professional medical associations.</p>
<p>The company also has marketing deals with Boston Scientific Corp, Allergan Inc and Smith &amp; Nephew Plc. It is an exclusive provider of cardiac outcomes systems to Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;We're disappointed and embarrassed by our results,&quot; Green said. &quot;On the flip side, our level of activity going into the fourth quarter is over two times the level of activity we had going into the third quarter.&quot;</p>
