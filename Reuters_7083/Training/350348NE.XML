<headline>Computron names John Rade Pres/CEO.</headline>
<dateline>RUTHERFORD, N.J. 1997-02-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Computron Software Inc said Monday that John Rade has been elected director, president and chief executive of Computron and the company is &quot;actively recruiting&quot; a new chief financial officer.</p>
<p>Computron said the new executives will replace Adrian Peters, formerly director, president and chief executive and Alex Comandini, formerly chief financial officer, who have left the company.  </p>
<p>The company declined to comment on the reasons for the management changes.</p>
<p>Late last month, Computron said information had come to its attention that may impact previously reported financial results. The company said its independent auditors will withdraw their reports on the company's previously reported financial statements.</p>
<p>The company said it asked Arthur Anderson, its auditors, to assist in the evaluation of the possible impact of that information on previously reported financial statements.  </p>
<p>&quot;Management is not releasing any more information now,&quot; Elaine Matraxia, Computron's investor relations administrator, said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Computron said Rade has had extensive corporate restructuring experience.</p>
<p>Rade joins Computron from S-Cubed International, a company he founded in the client server system development and consulting market, Computron said.  </p>
<p>In October, Computron said it named Comandini CFO, replacing Richard Yonker, who resigned.</p>
<p>Earlier that month, Computron said it was cutting 12 percent of its workforce to bring the company's total number of employees to 475. The company said it was eliminating activities that do not effect core product development and customer service in a bid to return Computron to profitability.</p>
<p>In November, Computron reported a third quarter loss of $0.39 a share compared to a profit of $0.07 per share in the 1995 period.</p>
