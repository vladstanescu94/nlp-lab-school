<p>FTP Software Inc said on Thursday it expects to report a charge in the third quarter ending September 30 in the range of $13 to $16 million, or $0.38 to $0.47 per share, from its restructuring.</p>
<p>FTP said the charge will account for a reduction in its worldwide workforce of approximately 38 percent, consolidation of facilities and a reduction of associated physical assets.</p>
<p>In addition, the company expects to report a second quarter operating loss from continuing operations before taxes in the range of $13.7 to $14.2 million and revenue in the range of $17.4 to $17.8 million.  </p>
<p>The company said it would realign its business into three units, the VIP Network Applications Business, IP Technology Business and Agent/Directory Business units.</p>
<p>The VIP unit will develop desktop and Web-based network application solutions, the IP unit will develop server based connectivity solutions and the Agent/Directory unit will develop next generation network administration and management applications.  </p>
<p>Glenn Hazard, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement, &quot;These strategic business units allow us to focus our effort and resources in those areas that provide the most benefit to our customers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To create a path toward a successful future for these three business units and return the company to a more solid financial position, we have taken significant actions to align our resources appropriately,&quot; concluded Hazard.</p>
<p>The company expects to substantially complete the planned associated actions by the end of the third quarter.</p>
<p>FTP said it will publish its final second quarter revenue results on July 23.</p>
<p>First Call analysts estimate FTP will report a second quarter loss per share of $0.25.  The company had previously announced that it would not meet its internal expectations for the second quarter ended June 30.</p>
<p>FTP produces internetworking software enabling personal computer users to access heterogeneous resources across local area, enterprise wide and global networks.</p>
