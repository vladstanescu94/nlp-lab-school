<p>Under the agreement, Novell agreed to endorse Computer Associates's Unicenter TNG as its preferred management software for large systems and Computer Associates agreed to endorse Novell's ManageWise as its preferred local area network (LAN) management product for the Novell networking software.  </p>
<p>Computer Associates President and Chief Operating Officer Sanjay Kumar said Unicenter is deployed in more than 5,000 customer sites around the world and Novell President and Chief Operating Officer Joe Marengi noted Novell's software runs on around four million network servers with 60 million users around the world.</p>
<p>The companies said they were not attached to a specific business model for combining the products going forward, but the two companies would collaborate to ensure the products work well together in an effort to boost overall sales.</p>
<p>Computer Associates will resell ManageWise as a Unicenter TNG option for its customers using IntranetWare and NetWare and bundle a specialized version of the product with certain selected versions of Unicenter TNG, it said.</p>
<p>Novell will also bundle a specialized version of Unicenter TNG for IntranetWare with certain versions of its IntranetWare and ManageWise offerings, in addition to a version of Computer Associates's ARCserve product.</p>
