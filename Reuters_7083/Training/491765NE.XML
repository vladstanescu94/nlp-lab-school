<p>While Rational Software was not immediately available to provide the total value of the purchase, the company said it would take an unspecified one-time charge in the second quarter for merger-related costs.</p>
<p>Separately, Pure Atria said it expected its first quarter revenue and earnings for its first quarter ended March 31 would be below analysts' forecasts.</p>
<p>Pure Atria, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said it expected first quarter earnings to be between about $0.02 per share and $0.04 per share, excluding a one-time charge associated with its acquisition of Integrity QA Software.  </p>
<p>The First Call consensus earnings estimate for the first quarter was $0.12 per share compared to $0.09 per share the company earned in last year's first quarter.</p>
<p>Its first quarter revenues would likely be around $30 million, the company said.</p>
<p>Pure Atria, which said it planned to report full results after the market close on April 17, was not immediately available to comment further.</p>
<p>Rational Software said its purchase of Pure Atria was expected to be accounted for as a pooling of interests and to qualify as a tax-free reorganization.  </p>
<p>It was set to close in the third quarter, Rational said.</p>
<p>Rational Software said it aimed to create a software company which would operate globally with products to automate the component-based development of software applications.</p>
<p>&quot;By quickly integrating the Pure Atria sales operation into the Rational field sales operation and quickly integrating the industry-leading Pure Atria and Rational products in the context of Rational's proven business model, we are creating in Rational a partner that customers around the world can depend on,&quot; Rational chairman Paul Levy said. Levy would remain Rational's chairman.</p>
<p>Pure Atria's main lines of business would become new units within Rational's products group, it said.</p>
<p>Pure Atria Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings would become Rational's chief technical officer, it said.</p>
<p>Pure Atria and Rational have granted reciprocal options to to buy newly issued shares equal to about 19.9 percent of each of the issuing company's outstanding shares, Rational said.</p>
<p>Outstanding options to buy Pure Atria stock would be converted at the exchange ratio into Rational options, it said.</p>
