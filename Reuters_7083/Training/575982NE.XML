<p>The tide is turning in Microsoft Corp's campaign to ensure Chinese personal computer makers ship their products complete with legitimate copies of the U.S. giant's software, a senior company official said on Monday.</p>
<p>Nearly a decade of persuasion, sales incentives and China's crackdown on piracy were persuading local firms to bundle Microsoft products on new computers, said Joachim Kempin, Senior Vice President of OEM (original equipment manufacturer) Sales.</p>
<p>&quot;Progress over the first five or six years has been really slow, but I think we have seen over the last two or three years that... the tide is changing,&quot; Kempin said in an interview.</p>
<p>In 1996, about 30 percent of personal computers sold in China had legitimate software, such as Microsoft's ubiquitous Windows operating system, but that figure could rise to 50 percent this year, he said.</p>
<p>Pirated software is widely available in China and many local computer vendors routinely install hundreds of dollars worth of illegally copied programmes into the memories of their wares to attract customers.</p>
<p>China's personal computer sales are expected to soar from about 1.8 million units last year -- but while demand for software is keeping pace, the vast majority of applications sold are cut-price pirated copies.</p>
<p>Beijing has come under frequent fire from Western governments and international software and music associations for failing to curb the abuse of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>A multibillion dollar Sino-U.S. trade war over the issue was narrowly averted in early 1996 by an accord under which China vowed to take tougher action on pirates and to open further its intellectual property markets to foreign companies.</p>
<p>Progress in the last 12 months had been clear, said Bryan Nelson, Microsoft's Greater China Region managing director.</p>
<p>&quot;I see a very sincere and aggressive effort by the Chinese government to work much more closely with the industry and with customers in trying to reduce the amount of piracy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;China is maturing as an industry quite rapidly,&quot; he said. &quot;We're seeing improvement.&quot;</p>
<p>Company officials said hundreds of Chinese computer makers were already buying Microsoft products through a variety of distribution licensing schemes.</p>
<p>&quot;We basically try to work with every single manufacturer in the world, we don't care how big it is,&quot; said Kempin, who was in Beijing to launch the simplified Chinese version of Microsoft's Office 97 software package.</p>
<p>The U.S. computer giant was persuading PC makers to sign up for licensed software by offering value-added services such as help with marketing, he said.</p>
<p>Makers also benefited from a more reliable software source and product support that gave customers a better &quot;out of box experience&quot; when they unwrapped their new computers, he said.</p>
<p>In March, Microsoft signed a licensing deal for the installation of Windows 95 in computers made by Legend Group, China's top personal computer maker and the controlling parent of the Hong Kong-listed Legend.</p>
<p>While Microsoft would focus most of its energy on educating Chinese suppliers and consumers on the benefits of legitimate software, it would also continue to be involved in efforts to crack down on copyright offenders, Nelson said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not here to police anything, (but) if we have to do a little of that then fine,&quot; he said.</p>
