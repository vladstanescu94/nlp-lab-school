<title>USA: First Eagle fund buying defense, finance stocks.</title>
<headline>First Eagle fund buying defense, finance stocks.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>First Eagle Fund of America, which marked its 10th anniversary on Thursday, is heavily invested in defense and financial stocks, executives said.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the fund has added to its position in Chase Manhattan Corp, which was a significant holding in the first quarter at about 44,000 shares.</p>
<p>&quot;With Chase and Citicorp, you have stocks with low P/Es,&quot; Harold Levy, co-president of the fund, told reporters at a luncheon briefing. Chase, he said, was especially attractive with a P/E of 10, based on expected 1997 earnings, and as it buys back large blocks of stock and cuts costs.  </p>
<p>Other top finance holdings include BankBoston Corp, at about 104,000 shares; Finova Group Inc, at about 93,000 shares; Citicorp at about 39,000 shares.</p>
<p>Levy and the other managers said that the changing capital structure, through such means as buybacks, and expense cutting has led the $200 million fund to put about 23 percent of assets into the sector.</p>
<p>In recent weeks the value fund has also bought two gaming stocks, Mirage Resorts Inc and International Game Technology, citing the pounding that the stocks have taken in recent weeks.  </p>
<p>David Cohen, a fund vice president, said that Mirage's stock has suffered because some investors are worried about the increasing debt from the building of new properties. He believes the new casinos will generate more cash flow.</p>
<p>The fund focuses on stocks that are selling at a sharp discount, and have managements that understand how to increase the share price, especially via fundamental methods.</p>
<p>Levy said the fund pays little attention to such factors as earnings growth potential because that often doesn't consider the long-term direction of the company.  </p>
<p>The fund has about eight percent in technology stocks, including International Business Machines Corp, which is selling at about ten times expected 1997 earnings, has healthy cash flow, and uses some cash to buy back stock.</p>
<p>Another favorite is Seagate Technology Inc, a computer disc drive maker that Levy figures has about $8 per share in cash flow. Shares were off 7/8 to 48-5/8.</p>
<p>Levy said he is taking a look at Bay Networks Inc, another beaten down tech stock that has recruited new managers in the past year.  </p>
<p>Asked by a reporter about the fund's operating expenses of 1.76 percent, co-president John Arnhold acknowledged it was steep, but said investors were paying for a long-term, stable strategy, with good returns.</p>
<p>According to Lipper Analytical Services, in the five-year period, ended March, the fund ranked first out of 56 capital appreciation funds.</p>
<p>In 1996, it returned 29.34 percent compared to an average 16.32 for the sector. So far this year, it has lost 1.20 percent compared to an average of 3.26 percent for the group.</p>
