<p>Total worldwide package software market grew by about 11.9 percent in 1996, according to year-end software research released Monday by International Data Corporation.</p>
<p>In contrast, this market grew 15.4 percent in 1995, the research firm said.  </p>
<p>International Business Machines Corp maintained its top position with an 11.9 percent share of worldwide software revenues of $12.5 billion, off from 12.9 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>Microsoft Corp scored a nine percent share, while Computer Associates International Inc held a 4.5 percent share, IDC said.</p>
<p>Several roles played a part in the tempered growth in 1996, IDC said. They included a failure of Microsoft Windows 95/NT operating systems to duplicate the revenue it gained in 1995. Also, IDC cited the introduction of new pricing models, like IBM's bundled pricing in the mainframe market.  </p>
<p>IDC also note that the growth in overall client/server architected software has slowed.</p>
<p>Despite the slower growth rate compared to 1995, IDC said it remains optimistic about future worldwide packaged software revenue, with software market growth seen at between 10 and 12 percent through 2001.</p>
<p>Worldwide applications revenues grew 14.4 percent over 1995 to $49 billion, representing 47 percent of all packaged software sales. Growth was spurred on by the strength of the office suites, consumer applications, sales force automation and customer service/help desk segments.</p>
<p>IDC said system-level software is expected to grow 8.1 percent to $28.2 billion in 1996, with $50 billion in total annual revenues seen by 2001, spurred on by demand for operating systems and system management software.</p>
<p>The overall application development tools market is estimated to grow to $27.7 billion in 1996, with annual growth of 12 to 13 percent predicted through 2001, IDC said.</p>
