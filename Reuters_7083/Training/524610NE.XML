<p>Japan's Softbank Corp will continue its strong earnings growth in the year to end-March 1998 as its U.S. subsidiaries start contributing to group profits, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>Softbank, whose earnings have grown spectacularly due to a series of bold investments by its charismatic president Masayoshi Son, will unveil its business results for the year ended March 31, 1997, as well as earnings forecasts for the current financial year on Thursday.</p>
<p>Despite strong growth, analysts' were mixed on whether Softbank -- burdened with 270 billion yen in debt -- was an attractive investment target.</p>
<p>Some cited uncertainties over its future business prospects, including a planned satellite broadcasting venture with Sony Corp and News Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;We still don't know whether the venture, Japan Sky Broadcasting, will be able to yield profits,&quot; said Tadao Imanaka, an analyst at Okasan Economic Research Institute.</p>
<p>&quot;And Softbank does not cast much of a shadow in the project,&quot; Imanaka added, referring to the expected strong leadership by the other two companies.</p>
<p>Son recently told Reuters that the three firms would participate on an equal basis in the venture, but a formal announcement has been delayed.</p>
<p>Softbank's share prices dipped as low as 4,544 yen on the over-the-counter market on December 24, down from a high of 12,087 yen set on April 9, 1996, as investors focused on Softbank's large debts following the acquisition of U.S. memory board maker Kingston Technology in August.</p>
<p>But prices rebounded earlier this year and closed at 7,920 yen on Monday. &quot;The weak yen and Sony's participation in the JSkyB venture, among others, relieved investors,&quot; said Yasuaki Fujine, an analyst at Smith Barney International.</p>
<p>The weak yen raises the asset value of Softbank's dollar-based U.S. investments, such as Ziff-Davis Publishing and the Comdex industry trade show.</p>
<p>Analysts' forecasts on Softbank's 1997/98 group net profits range from 19 billion yen to 20 billion yen.</p>
<p>&quot;The growth comes purely from the major U.S. units which started making full contributions to the group for the first time this year,&quot; said Okasan's Imanaka.</p>
<p>He said he was cautious about making a long-term investment in Softbank, however, saying recent weakness in Internet-related issues in the U.S. stock market was a concern.</p>
<p>&quot;Softbank depends heavily on its U.S. PC and Internet-related businesses, and is now more susceptible to fluctuations in the U.S. technology sector,&quot; Imanaka said.</p>
<p>He also said Softbank may post an extraordinary loss of about three to four billion yen with the launch of the JSkyB project this year. He expects losses in the broadcasting business to peak in the following year.</p>
<p>But Smith Barney's Fujine said the planned listing of some of Softbank's units this year, such as Yahoo! Japan and UT StarCom, may offset the loss from the broadcasting business.</p>
<p>The following are business forecasts by analysts (in</p>
<p>billions of yen):</p>
<p>Parent current profit (95/96 results -- 13.08)</p>
<p>			   Okasan   Nikko Research</p>
<p> 96/97 estimate	19.5	  19</p>
<p> 97/98 forecast	29	    24</p>
<p> Group net profit (95/96 results -- 5.79)</p>
<p> 96/97 estimate	12.5	  12.5</p>
<p> 97/98 forecast	19	    20</p>
