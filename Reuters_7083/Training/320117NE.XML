<headline>Malaysia multimedia hub gets high-level backing.</headline>

<p>Malaysia boosted its ambitions to become a global multimedia hub after a Who's Who of the information technology industry agreed to be advisers to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>Mahathir was in Tokyo on Monday meeting Japanese business executives after a successful week-long roadshow in California last week to persuade top information technology companies to invest in his pet project, the so-called Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC).</p>
<p>The California trip saw Mahathir chairing the first meeting of the project's 30-member international advisory panel of leading experts, including business rivals.</p>
<p>The panel includes Microsoft Corp chief executive Bill Gates and the chief executives of IBM, Apple Computer Inc, Sony Corp, Oracle Corp, Sun Microsystems Inc, Compaq, Motorola Inc, Netscape, Siemens AG, Nippon Telephone and Telegraph among others.  </p>
<p>Mahathir's brainchild, the corridor is a planned 15 km-by-40 km (nine mile-by-25 mile) area stretching south from Kuala Lumpur to a new international airport and the new administrative capital of Putrajaya.</p>
<p>Malaysia hopes to attract a variety of vendors from the information superhighway -- from software designers and electronic publishers to film production houses, Internet service providers, telemedicine and education firms.</p>
<p>&quot;Malaysia's ambition to become a major player in the global information technology market will be realised with the setting up of the MSC,&quot; said stockbrokerage Jupiter Securities in a report on Monday.</p>
<p>Mahathir is pushing the corridor as part of efforts to move Malaysia beyond just a low-tech assembler of electronic products for multinational corporations.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel the MSC has received very good support and I am confident it will be a success,&quot; Mahathir told Malaysian reporters at the end of his U.S. visit.</p>
<p>Andreas Lim, business development manager at Microsoft (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, said the company had &quot;great confidence and understanding of what is required&quot; to complete the MSC.  </p>
<p>The corridor will initially be driven by three mega-projects that will be major consumers of multimedia products and services.</p>
<p>One is the new capital of Putrajaya, designed to be an &quot;intelligent city&quot; with a paperless administration. The others are the new airport and the Kuala Lumpur City Centre, a massive office highrise project featuring the Petronas Twin Towers, the world's tallest buildings at 452 metres (1,482 feet).</p>
<p>Analysts said there were issues Malaysia needed to tackle to make the plan a success. Lack of skilled industry workers is perhaps the biggest. Software piracy is also a problem as are potential trade barriers that may impede marketing efforts in neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>&quot;We already recognise the (piracy) legislation that is in place, and know that the enforcement is already happening,&quot; said Lim at Microsoft. &quot;It's just the judiciary that needs ironing out. Stiffer penalties are needed to adequately deter piracy.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said expectations that the MSC project would take off had already given a boost to technology stocks on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange.</p>
