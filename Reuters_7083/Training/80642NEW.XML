<p>Microsoft Corp. Friday said its sales growth and profit margins may decline in fiscal 1997 after big gains in the prior year that were driven largely by the launch of the Windows 95 operating system.</p>
<p>In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Microsoft focused on a likely slowdown in revenue growth in the first two quarters of the fiscal year that began July 1, and it noted that the operating expenses were expected to increase in the current year.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the fixed nature of a signficant portion of such expenses, coupled with the possibility of slower revenue growth, operating margins in 1997 may decrease from those in 1996,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>But industry analysts said the statement merely refelcted the company's traditional conservatism in its public comments about its financial outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;We're accustomed to these kind of comments in the company's annual report to shareholders,&quot; said Rick Sherlund at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</p>
<p>He and other analysts said they expected the company's profit margins to rise this year, although Microsoft is not expected to repeat its high revenue growth rate.</p>
<p>Microsoft executives previously had told industry analysts and reporters they expected revenue growth this year to be lower than the 46 percent reported for the year that ended June 30 and which included the new Windows system.</p>
<p>&quot;This was an unusually high growth rate -- the highest since '92,&quot; chief financial officer Mike Brown told Reuters in July. &quot;I don't expect as much next year.&quot;</p>
<p>Analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie estimated Microsoft's revenue would grow 22 percent this year to $10.59 billion, compared with last year's $8.67 billion.</p>
<p>He estimated Microsoft's operating profit margin would rise to 37.4 percent of revenues from 35.5 percent last year and 34.3 percent in fiscal 1995. He estimated Microsoft would generate net income of $2.74 billion or $4.15 a share this year, up from $2.19 billion or $3.43 a share.</p>
<p>Microsoft stock, which rose $2.375 to $134.375 in Nasdaq trading Friday, fell $1.25 in the after-hours market on the cautionary statement, traders said.</p>
<p>In a letter published in the company's annual report to shareholders Friday, Microsoft Chairman officer Bill Gates emphasized he and other company executives were optimistic about the company's prospects.</p>
<p>&quot;In our dialogue with the financial community, we go out of our way to point out the challenges of maintaining or increasing our profitability,&quot; Gates said. &quot;Despite this, we feel the prospects for our business over the next decade are very strong.&quot;</p>
<p>A proxy statement sent to shareholders disclosed that Gates was paid $563,000 in salary and bonus last year, a raise of about $147,000 over fiscal 1995. His 24 percent stake in the company was valued at nearly $19 billion.</p>
