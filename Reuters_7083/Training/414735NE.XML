<p>Softbank Corp said on Monday that the reason behind its planned sale of all of its shares in Asahi National Broadcasting Co (TV Asahi) was not financial.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is no reason for us to sell the (TV Asahi) shares from a financial viewpoint,&quot; Softbank president Masayoshi Son told a news conference in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Softbank, which has become the world's largest publisher of computer-related magazines and books through a string of bold buy-outs, has been an aggressive borrower in the bond market.</p>
<p>Earlier, Softbank Corp announced that it and News Corp had agreed to sell all of their TV Asahi shares to the Japanese network's affiliate, the mass-circulation Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun, for 41.75 billion yen.</p>
<p>Softbank and News Corp jointly bought 5,136 shares of TV Asahi for the same amount in June 1996.</p>
<p>Softbank also said in a statement that both TV Asahi and Asahi Shimbun, one of TV Asahi's biggest shareholders, will continue to support the Japanese satellite television project, Japan Sky Broadcasting Co, or JSkyB, planned by Softbank and News Corp.  </p>
<p>Asked about the possible management role of Sony Corp in the JskyB project, News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch told the same news conference that the three companies --- News Corp, Sony and Softbank -- were negotiating as &quot;equal partners&quot; over how to launch the project.</p>
<p>Son also said the three companies had basically agreed to become equal partners on the project.</p>
<p>&quot;We had bought the TV Asahi shares to ensure the success of the JskyB project,&quot; Son said. &quot;But since the Asahi Shimbun had strongly demanded that it buy the shares, and because we got an agreement from the Asahi Shimbun to provide further cooperation in exchange for selling the shares, we came to that decision.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that details of the pact will be discussed later, but that the Asahi Shimbun was due to give its support in building up various channels and obtaining content.</p>
<p>The payment date for the shares has not been decided, Asahi Shimbun president Muneyuki Matsushita told the same news conference. &quot;The share purchase is a part of our efforts to reach the target of becoming a media conglomerate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the two firms accepted our offer to buy the TV Asahi shares, we would like to cooperate in the JskyB project as much as possible,&quot; Matsushita said.</p>
