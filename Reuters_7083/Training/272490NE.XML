<p>Apple Computer Inc.'s rehiring of company co-founder Steve Jobs and purchase of NeXT Software Inc. will give it a much-needed operating system, but analysts warned Monday the deal might not be enough to boost the computer maker's market share or bottom line.</p>
<p>&quot;(The move) has a lot of PR value, but it looks to me that the company still has a strategic mess on its hand with $400 million less,&quot; said John Rossi, an analyst at the Robertson Stephens &amp; Co. brokerage in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Apple said Friday it would pay $400 million to buy NeXT and rehire NeXT founder Jobs, Apple's mercurial co-founder, as part of a plan to revamp the Macintosh computer.</p>
<p>Apple bought NeXT because it needs an operating system -- the program that controls a computer's basic functions -- after its own attempt failed.</p>
<p>While NeXT's existing technology helps Apple make up for lost time and provides a decent foundation for a new operating system, the technology is not dazzling enough to set the Macintosh apart from computers running Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Trying to prop up the brand name with a psychological hire is not going to solve Apple's problems,&quot; said one Wall Street analyst who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>Analysts note that NeXT has failed to make any dent in the consumer computer market on its own. The company sold only 50,000 computers in four years as a hardware manufacturer before it focused entirely on software.</p>
<p>Some analysts also are disappointed that Apple chose NeXT over Be Inc., a closely held software company founded by another former Apple executive, Jean-Louis Gassee.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw Be's technology. I was wowed by it,&quot; Rossi said. Be had many features that would have appealed to Macintosh customers, who do a lot of graphics design, video and image editing and desktop publishing. NeXT, Rossi said, &quot;is aged&quot; in comparison.</p>
<p>Still, Apple needed to come up with a technological blueprint to persuade outside software companies not to abandon the Macintosh.</p>
<p>By making no secret they were shopping around for technology, Apple's management had essentially told their customers the current Macintosh system was a dead end, analysts said.</p>
<p>If Apple had taken much longer to present its plan, Macintosh software developers would have begun to look for other ways to make a living.</p>
<p>&quot;The technology direction implicit in the acquisition is a good one,&quot; said Ike Nassi, a former Apple executive and computer scientist who headed the software development effort.</p>
<p>Some investors agreed. Apple shares rose 12.5 cents to $23.625 in afternoon Nasdaq trading. The shares jumped $1.25 to $23.50 Friday as word spread of Apple's decision to buy NeXT, based in Redwood City, Calif.</p>
<p>Analysts said they may have to wait months to get a clearer picture from Apple about what the combination of NeXT and Apple software will look like.</p>
<p>&quot;Merging operating systems is not a simple task,&quot; said Peter Andrew, an analyst at brokerage AG Edwards.</p>
<p>And it is still unclear where Apple will get the software expertise to include key features in the new operating system.</p>
<p>For example, neither Apple nor NeXT's software is efficient at handling several tasks simultaneously, such as recalculating a spreadsheet while faxing a document and updating stock quotes on the screen.</p>
<p>&quot;There are many issues about how the NeXT operating system can revitalize the Mac,&quot; said Richard Zwetchkenbaum, an analyst at market researcher International Data Corp.</p>
<p>Apple executives are expected to give more technological details about their plan Jan. 7 at the MacWorld trade show in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with investment bank JP Morgan's San Francisco office, said Jobs, even if he helps Apple comes up with a brilliant operating system quickly, cannot save Apple alone.</p>
<p>&quot;My investment thesis on Apple hinges on a lot of mileposts,&quot; including reporting a decent Christmas quarter this year and revamping its entire product line in 1997, Kunstler said. Finding an operating system was just one milepost, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The PC industry is one of the most dynamic and competitive in the world, and this announcement underscores that fact,&quot; said Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray. &quot;We look forward to watching their efforts and competing in the marketplace.&quot;</p>
<p>He pointed out that Microsoft has been the biggest developer of applications for the Macintosh platform over the past 15 years.</p>
<p>&quot;Until Apple provides more details on their future plans, it's going to be hard for anyone to say how they will partner with or support this new venture,&quot; he said. But he added that Microsoft would take a &quot;hard look&quot; at any new system, depending on customer demand.</p>
