<p>Educational software provider SoftKey International Inc., which has been on a buying binge this year, said Thursday that it posted a loss of $93 million in its latest quarter after taking $121 million in charges related to acquisitions.</p>
<p>Despite the big loss, the company's stock shot up $3.50 to $24.50 on the Nasdaq market, where it was one of the most heavily traded issues.</p>
<p>The company, known for its Reader Rabbit educational programmes for children, also announced that it was immediately changing its name to The Learning Company Inc. and moving its stock to the New York Stock Exchange from Nasdaq in the middle of next month.</p>
<p>The Cambridge, Mass.-based company said it lost $93.18 million, or $2.08 a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with net income of $10.0 million, or 36 cents a share, a year ago.</p>
<p>The company also said it took amortization and acquisition charges of $120.8 million releated to acquisitions. Excluding those charges and provision for deferred income taxes, the company said its net income for the quarter would have been $20.9 million, or 47 cents a share.</p>
<p>The company said its revenues in the quarter more than doubled to $90.1 million from $41.6 million as its core publishing business grew by 30 percent.</p>
<p>It said revenues included sales from its three recent acquisitions -- The Learning Company, Compton's New Media Inc. and Minnesota Educational Computing Corp.</p>
<p>The company also said it suffered a net loss of $313.7 million, or $8.02 a share, for the first nine months of the year after taking a charge of $373.4 million releated to acquisitions.</p>
<p>That compared with net income of $22.8 million, or 83 cents a share, a year ago.</p>
