<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission said Thursday it has filed a lawsuit against Systems of Excellence Inc. and its chairman, Charles Huttoe, for alleged &quot;massive market manipulation&quot; involving shares of the company.</p>
<p>In a civil complaint filed in federal district court here, the agency alleged that Huttoe, a 49-year-old Miami resident, secretly distributed about 43 million company shares to his family members and corporations.</p>
<p>He allegedly manipulated the market by issuing false, favourable information concerning the company, using a stock promoter, and then selling his shares after its price had artificially risen, the SEC said.</p>
<p>Huttoe allegedly &quot;engaged in a massive coverup,&quot; after the company's auditors found evidence of unregistered distribution of the company's shares and raised questions about the matter in mid-September, the SEC said.</p>
<p>Systems of Excellence, a maker of video teleconferencing equipment, has offices in McLean, Va., and Coral Gables, Fla.</p>
<p>Also named in the civil complaint are six companies, including stock promoter SGA Goldstar Research Inc., and certain relatives of Huttoe, including his wife Karen Purvis, his mother and a niece.</p>
<p>The SEC's action comes after it suspended trading of the company's stock for 10 days beginning Oct. 7 because of questions about the accuracy of information disseminated to the market.</p>
<p>The SEC is seeking to recover at least $10 million that investors allegedly lost because of Huttoe's and other defendants' wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The SEC has asked the court to issue a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction and other emergency relief, including the freezing of the company's bank accounts.</p>
<p>Cynthia Gramer, a company spokesperson, said from Boston that &quot;a group of people have taken the company in hand.</p>
<p>&quot;They are doing everything in their power to uncover what was wrong and make it right,&quot; she said. &quot;Apparently there is a great deal that needs to be fixed.&quot;</p>
<p>Huttoe could not be reached for comment.</p>
