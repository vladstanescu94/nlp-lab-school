<p>The European Union's competition chief, Karel Van Miert, said on Wednesday he was investigating complaints of anti-competitive software distribution practices in the EU.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking into some of these cases,&quot; he said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Despite repeated questions, Van Miert refused to give any details. But he has previously said the European Commission was investigating a complaint about the pricing practices of U.S. software giant Microsoft Corp.</p>
<p>That complaint was filed more than a year ago by the Personal Computer Association in Britain, which said on Wednesday it was getting impatient for results.</p>
<p>&quot;We're rather frustrated that we have had no satisfactory advance from the Commission on this matter,&quot; PCA executive director Keith Warburton told Reuters.</p>
<p>The PCA charges Microsoft with abusing its dominant position in its pricing practices, when selling the MS Office software package to personal computer manufacturers who want to &quot;bundle&quot; it into the machines they sell.</p>
<p>It says Microsoft charges a handful of key customers, including U.S. computer maker Gateway 2000, much lower prices than it charges the rest of its customers.</p>
<p>&quot;The result of this is that Microsoft as a monopoly supplier is restricting the availability of a monopoly product,&quot; Warburton said.</p>
<p>When asked about the complaint last year by a British European Parliament deputy, Graham Watson, Van Miert responded that he was discussing the charges with Microsoft.</p>
<p>&quot;The extent to which Microsoft, which appears to be a dominant supplier, can charge different prices for different customers, and other aspects of their license contracts with computer manufacturers, are currently being discussed with Microsoft's management,&quot; he said in a written response.</p>
<p>&quot;The answer I got was not terribly satisfying,&quot; Watson told Reuters. &quot;The Commission said, we will look into it.&quot;</p>
<p>The complaint is not the first time the Commission has scrutinised Microsoft. It said last year it was studying the impact on competition of Microsoft's online service, the Microsoft Network.</p>
<p>It also cooperated with the U.S. Justice Department in an investigation that resulted in a 1994 settlement under which Microsoft ended certain licensing practices that were seen to harm competition.</p>
<p>Microsoft officials in Europe were unavailable for comment.</p>
