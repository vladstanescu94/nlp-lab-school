<p>Shares in computer technology developer Formulab Neuronetics Corp Ltd rocketed to the top of the turnover list on Wednesday with a total of 179.38 million shares traded amid talk founder Tony Richter had exited the company.</p>
<p>The bulk of the business was in two lines of 150.54 million and 28.25 million, both at 25 cents per share, specialled through Prudential-Bache Securities Australia.  </p>
<p>Brokers said market speculation was that Richter had sold out, with the shares going to a group of U.S. institutional investors.</p>
<p>The large volumes were accounted for by the release from escrow of shares held by Richter, the brokers said.</p>
<p>Formulab was not available for comment.</p>
<p>The company was formed to launch the Richter Paradigm Computer, a computer system that is supposed to mimic the human brain and that can process more complex problems than existing personal computers.  </p>
<p>On July 11, Formulab appointed former Insignia Solutions Plc chief executive Robert P. Lee as chief executive officer of both Formulab and its wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, Richter Paradigm Corp.</p>
<p>Richter remained as executive chairman of Formulab and chairman of the technical committee.</p>
<p>On July 11 Richter Paradigm Corp signed an alliance with Tandem Computers Incorporated to pursue activities to promote the use of each other's products, while on August 5 the company said it had met all the requirements for Microsoft Corp licencing on Windows 95 and Window NT.  </p>
<p>Formulab shares closed three cents higher at 28.5 cents.</p>
<p>However, by 6.00 p.m. (0800 GMT), the two special lines had been cancelled by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) through its Stock Exchange Automated Trading System (SEATS).</p>
<p>No ASX official was available to explain the cancellation.</p>
