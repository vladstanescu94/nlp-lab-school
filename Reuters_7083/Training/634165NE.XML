<p>Verity Inc said it has agreed to pay $3.5 million to acquire 64k Inc, a company founded less than a year ago to develop technology for improving the speed of relational database searches.</p>
<p>Verity said the transaction will be accounted for as a purchase and it expects to take a charge of approximately $3.1 million, related to the acquisition of in-process research and development, in its fourth fiscal quarter ended May 31, 1997.  </p>
<p>Verity, which had been a minority investor in 64k when the company was founded in late October last year by former International Business Machines Corp database management researchers, said it plans to introduce a product utilizing the technology in first quarter 1998.</p>
<p>The company also said it plans to integrate 64k technology directly into its flagship SEARCH '97 platform.</p>
<p>The acquisition closed on May 31 and all of the 64k staff will now be employees of Verity and will hold a significant amount of stock options in Verity following the deal, company executives said in a conference call with media.</p>
<p>Executives said the acquisition was the third it has made in the last year in an effort to expand its product range.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, it completed the acquisition of Cognisoft, a supplier of corporate push technology known as IntelliServ, and FTP Software Inc's KEYview business.</p>
<p>Verity shares were up 25/32 at 7-5/32.</p>
<p>The staff OF 64K consists of five former employees of International Business Machines Corp who together have more than 40 years of combined experience in database management and related research, development and analysis.</p>
