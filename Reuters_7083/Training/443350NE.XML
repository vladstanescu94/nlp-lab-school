<p>Laser Storm Inc Friday said it expects to report a loss of about $2.5 million for the fourth quarter on revenues of about $773,000.</p>
<p>&quot;This large loss was the result of a significant drop-off in system sales from the previous quarter, as well as high development and marketing expenses attributable to the creation of Laser Storm's new X-Men laser tag game,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>No First Call consensus estimate was available for the company's fourth quarter earnings.  </p>
<p>Laser Storm said it completed its restructuring, begun December 6. Its corporate headquarters staff has been reduced by 30 employees. Chief Executive Bob Cooney said, &quot;The salary reductions alone will reduce the company's overhead by $1.5 million in 1997. Additional cost reductions in marketing, development, travel and other areas should reduce the company's expenses by an additional $1.0 million in 1997 over 1996.&quot;</p>
<p>The company said additional write-offs resulted from the termination of employees and officers under employment pacts. It estimates its loss for all of 1996 will be about $2.6 million on revenues of about $5.9 million.  </p>
<p>While the company incurred a loss in January, it was able to take additional cost-savings measures in early February. These measures, along with increased sales, allowed it to show a positive EBITDA in February.</p>
<p>Cooney added, &quot;We are excited about our financial performance in February, and March prospects look encouraging. The sales cycle for equipment sales, however, tends to be quite lengthy. This makes short-term sales predictability extremely difficult. This underscores the need to build our recurring revenue streams by opening additional company-owned stores.&quot;</p>
<p>Laser Storm is pursuing various financing alternatives to continue the rollout of its company-owned stores and to meet its working capital requirements.</p>
<p>Laser Storm, an operator of themed laser tag entertainment centers, also said the exercise price of the warrants issued as a part of the units in its public offering in April 1996 would almost certainly be reduced to $1.00 per share. The exercise price is adjustable based on the company's financial performance for the 12-month period ending March 31, 1997.</p>
