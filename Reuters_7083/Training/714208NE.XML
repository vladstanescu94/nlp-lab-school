<title>USA: Wall Data stock slides after earnings forecast.</title>
<headline>Wall Data stock slides after earnings forecast.</headline>
<dateline>KIRKLAND, Wash.</dateline>
<text>
<p>Wall Data Inc.'s stock fell about 33 percent Tuesday after the software company said it expects second-quarter earnings at just half of Wall Street forecasts.</p>
<p>The company also unsettled investors after it announced Monday that Chairman Jim Simpson will retire at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Wall Data fell $9.125 to $18.675 in morning trading on Nasdaq, on volume of 1.7 million shares, making the stock among the most active in U.S. markets. Earlier, the stock traded as low as $17.25.</p>
<p>Late Monday, Kirkland, Wash.-based Wall Data said its second-quarter earnings would be just half of what Wall Street expected, and that it will take a $10.7 million charge to settle a shareholder lawsuit.</p>
<p>The networking software company also said that Simpson, who is also chief executive, will retire at the end of July. John Wall, the company's founder and current president, will take over those positions.</p>
<p>Wall Data said it expects to report second-quarter earnings, before charges, of 17 cents to 20 cents a share. Wall Street expected earnings of 34 cents a share, according to a recent analyst survey by Zacks Investment Research.</p>
<p>Revenue for the quarter will be about $35.5 million, slightly higher than the $34.8 million reported in the same quarter a year ago, the company said.</p>
<p>Wall Data will take a $10.7 million charge in the quarter to settle shareholder lawsuits filed shortly after the company suffered a huge stock drop in early 1995. The charge also covers costs for restructuring the company's Salsa Business Unit, which writes multi-user PC software.</p>
<p>Wall Data specialises in software that lets computer users on Windows personal computers tap information stored on mainframe computers.</p>
