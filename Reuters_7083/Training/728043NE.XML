<p>Sun Microsystems Inc on Tuesday said it has endorsed Computer Associates International Inc's Unicenter TNG software, which allows a company to manage its computer network from a remote location.</p>
<p>The companies have also agreed to integrate Sun's Java computer language into Unicenter TNG and future products developed by Computer Associates.</p>
<p>Unicenter TNG is designed to help centrally manage, monitor and control all the information technology resources located worldwide in an organization -- including desktop computers, mainframes, local area networks, and access to the Internet.</p>
<p>Java is a language which promises to enable programmers to write one piece of software that can run on many different systems, Sun said.</p>
<p>Computer Associates plans to deliver products, written in Java, to monitor and manage Java Virtual Machines and JavaStation Network Computers, Sun's low-cost, scaled-down computers.</p>
<p>Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.  </p>
<p>Computer Associates also said its Unicenter TNG framework is based on Sun's Solaris platform. Computer Associates also plans to work with Sun to keeping the Unicenter TNG Framework current with Java Management standards.</p>
<p>Computer Associates will be shipping 1.5 milion copies of the framework over the next 12 months, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Charles Wang said at a conference in New Orleans. He noted, however, that the product was not yet available.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that within ninety days we will have the Java-based Unicenter TNG available,&quot; Wang said.</p>
