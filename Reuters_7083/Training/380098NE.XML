<p>Square Co Ltd said on Friday that it projected sales of 8.7 million units of game software in the next financial year beginning April 1997.  </p>
<p>A company executive told a news conference the firm had completed a three-year business plan in which it forecasts a parent current profit of 15 bln yen and a group current profit of 20 billion yen in the year to March 2000.</p>
<p>He said that in the year from April the company&quot;s parent current profit was projected to total 11 billion yen and a group net profit forecast of 7.9 billion yen.</p>
<p>Earlier, the game software maker announced it had revised down its parent current profit forecast for 1996/97 to 1.5 billion yen from its initial prediction of 9.1 billion yen.</p>
<p>Square also forecast a 1996/97 group net loss of 2.9 billion yen, down from its earlier forecast of a 5.3 billion yen profit.</p>
<p>The company said in a statement that the downward revision was a result of having to postpone the launch of four out of 11 software titles that were to have been released in the year to March 1997.</p>
<p>The company said it postponed the launch of the titles because it wanted to improve their quality to the same level as its mainstay &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, which was recently released for Sony Corp&quot;s 32-bit PlayStation game console.</p>
