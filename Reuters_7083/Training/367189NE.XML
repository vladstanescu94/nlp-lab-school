<p>Progressive Networks, the company that created Real Audio for the Internet, unveiled Real Video software to deliver video content over the Internet and support from over 50 entertainment and media companies.</p>
<p>Progressive Networks, privately-held and based in Seattle, said that Disney &amp; Co's ABC, Time Warner Inc, Cable News Network, News Corp's Fox News and MSNBC, a venture between Microsoft Corp and NBC, and many other companies announced support for Real Video.</p>
<p>Real Video delivers live and on-demand video for large scale distrubution over the Internet and corporate intranets.  </p>
<p>RealVideo is available for free beginning Monday by downloading the RealPlayer software from Progressive Network's Web site. The company said it believes that RealVideo will do for video what RealAudio did for audio on the Internet.</p>
<p>The RealPlayer software will also include RealAudio version 3.0. There are currently over 10 million users of RealAudio, the company estimates. Progressive Networks said it plans to make money by selling the software to run on network servers, which it will sell to the content providers who use the software to transmit video over the Internet.  </p>
<p>At a news conference in New York, director Spike Lee premiered three film shorts, three to five minutes long, that were developed using RealVideo.</p>
<p>Because of the lack of bandwidth, video over the Internet has been problematic. Video over the Internet still resides on only a small part of the entire screen, with some jerkiness and at a slower rate than full motion video.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe we have not completely cured cancer or cracked cold fusion, but we have it right a high perecentage of the time,&quot; said Rob Glaser, CEO of Progressive Networks, in an interview. &quot;We are boldly going where we haven't gone before.&quot;  </p>
<p>The RealPlayer is designed to run on PCs running an Intel Corp Pentium processor at speeds of 75 megahertz and above, running Microsoft Corp's Windows 95 or NT.</p>
<p>One content developer who is using the software said his firm has embraced RealVideo because it believes that it will become the de facto standard in Internet video, just in the same manner that RealAudio has become the audio standard.</p>
<p>&quot;It gives us another tool we can use,&quot; said Ken Locker, an executive producer at MGM Interactive. &quot;But the Internet is not television. When I say video, it's not even full motion video, which is 30 frames per second.&quot;  </p>
<p>Locker said RealVideo averages about seven to 12 frames per second.</p>
<p>&quot;It works very well and Progressive Networks is positioned to make theirs the standard,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>RealVideo works by sending packets of video in a stream from a server. If the client PC receives only 90 percent of all the packets, it sends a message back to the server asking for a retranmission and the stream is sent again.</p>
<p>Video streaming is not new and has been available on the Internet from companies such as privately-held VXtreme and VDONet.  </p>
<p>But analysts said that, because of the widespread adoption of RealAudio, they expect RealVideo to dominate.</p>
<p>&quot;They have a reputation with over 40,000 content developers, which use RealAudio equipped servers,&quot; said Jae Kim, an analyst at Paul Kagan &amp; Associates, in Carmel, Calif. &quot;It's a classic study of increasing return, you gain ubiquity by offering one product and then it's easier to make that migration (to the RealPlayer).&quot;</p>
<p>Kim expects that, because Progressive Networks has so much support from major content developers, RealVideo could play a big role in advertising on the Internet.</p>
<p>&quot;The announcement of video streaming is not significant in and of itself,&quot; Kim added. &quot;But the way the technology is implemented could have some signficant business impact...It's a way of delivering commercials and it will catch more consumer attention.&quot;</p>
