<p>Software maker Cognos Inc sees another strong year in fiscal 1998 and a share buyback or acquisition with its $100 million in cash, Chief Executive Ron Zambonini told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had a very strong year,&quot; Zambonini said of fiscal 1997 ended February 28. He added in an interview on Monday that 1998 would also be &quot;a big year.&quot;</p>
<p>Ottawa-based Cognos makes software to analyze business database information via sophisticated spreadsheets.</p>
<p>&quot;We have six new products and versions coming out in the first quarter,&quot; Zambonini said.</p>
<p>Zambonini said that Cognos, whose revenues grew 34 percent to US$51.3 million in the 1997 third quarter ended November 30, was considering how to use its cash hoard of more than US$100 million, he said.</p>
<p>Cognos' net earnings for the first nine months of fiscal 1997 rose to US$23.5 million or US$0.51 a share from year earlier US$10.1 million or US$0.23 a share.</p>
<p>&quot;We think when it's accretive, it makes sense to use our cash,&quot; Zambonini said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're actively looking right now for other products,&quot; he said. In early February, Cognos said it acquired London-based Right Information Systems Ltd, a business modeling and forecasting software developer, for $8 million in cash and stock.</p>
<p>He added that Cognos planned to expand operations in Europe, especially in Germany, Italy and Scandinavia.</p>
<p>A buyback of up to five percent of shares was another option, since the stock had taken a beating on Nasdaq and the Toronto Stock Exchange since late last year, Zambonini said.</p>
<p>Investors sold off after an analyst downgraded Cognos to a hold from a buy, saying the stock reached his target price in early December.</p>
<p>Cognos shares were up 0.20 to 32.75 in Toronto on Tuesday, down from a 52-week high of 53.50. Cognos was unchanged at 24-1/8 on Nasdaq, versus a 52-week high of about 39.</p>
