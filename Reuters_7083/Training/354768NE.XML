<title>USA: Windows-based PCs gain on Apple Macs.</title>

<p>Personal computers running Windows software from Microsoft Corp are gaining ground on Apple Computer Inc's Macintosh as the favored computer in grade schools, a report by a market researcher revealed.</p>
<p>In a survey by International Data Corp/LINK, grade schools said 56 percent of the new computers they plan to buy during the 1996-97 school year will run Windows software. The rest, 43 percent, would be computers from Apple.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Apple has been the teacher's pet among educators because of its easy-to-use computers. Microsoft, which has been coveting Apple's dominence of the educational market, launched an aggresive marketing campaign last summer aimed at schools to convince them to switch to PCs running Windows 95.</p>
<p>Based on Microsoft's foray and concerns about Apple's financial future, schools said for the first time they plan to buy more Windows-based PCs than Macs, the report found.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no question about it, school purchases are shifting to PCs running Windows,&quot; said William Ablondi, IDC/LINK analyst. &quot;Parents have a lot of influence over what goes on in the schools, and more and more want their children to learn what they are using in the workplace.&quot;</p>
<p>Apple, facing declining sales to corporate customers, gets a large portion of its revenue from sales to schools.</p>
<p>Apple officials said, however, the report is inconclusive because it does not measure what schools actually bought.</p>
<p>&quot;This report is doing nothing to suggest a change in the market share,&quot; said Carleen LeVasseur, Apple spokeswoman.</p>
<p>In the same report, LeVasseur pointed out, IDC/LINK found that 55 percent of the school districts said they plan to buy Apple computers in the school year. The rest said they planned to buy Windows machines.</p>
