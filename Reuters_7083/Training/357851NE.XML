<p>Open Market Inc said Wednesday it had signed a definitive deal to acquire Waypoint Software Corp, for about $12 million in cash and equity.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal are expected to be finalized in the current quarter ending in March.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman said &quot;a substantial portion of the purchase price will be accounted for as a one-time charge&quot; to write-off in-process research and development. The charge will be taken in the quarter when the deal is finally completed, she said.</p>
<p>Waypoint is a software developer that creates business-to- business catalogs that link manufacturers via the Internet.  </p>
<p>The Open Market spokeswoman declined comment on whether, or when, the deal would become accretive to earnings. She said Open Market does not make projections on results but would keep investors informed of developments.</p>
<p>Boston-based Waypoint's software enables rapid development of business-to-business catalogs for the Internet and quick retrieval of complex product information for product specifiers in the manufacturing industry, the company said.</p>
<p>Open Market said the technology enables companies in the computer, electronics, mechanical and instrumentation fields to retrieve product information from online catalogs.  </p>
<p>According to industry analyst Yankee Group, Internet-based business-to-business ordering is expected to grow from about $1 billion in 1996 to nearly $134 billion by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Open Market said Waypoint software will be integrated into its core OM-Transact Internet commerce software, an Electronic Data Interchange system with online cataloging features.</p>
<p>Over time, the company plans to offer a complete end-to-end Internet commerce solution, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Together, we'll be able to offer a best-of-breed solution that makes Internet commerce a reality for industrial manufacturers,&quot; said Greg Erman, chief executive of Waypoint.</p>
<p>&quot;What makes this deal unique is the synergy between Open Market's industrial strength back-office architecture and Waypoint's feature-rich front office applications,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>With the deal, Open Market said it gained a major customer and distribution channel in Cahners Publishing, a unit of Anglo Dutch publisher Reed Elsevier Plc NV</p>
<p>In January, Cahners said its Manufacturing Marketplace Website would use Waypoint software to offer the 50,000 manufacturers that advertise in Cahners's stable of trade magazines a way to create industrial catalogs on the Internet.</p>
