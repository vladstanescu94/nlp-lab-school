<p>Software giant Microsoft Corp. said Monday the Middle East was a major growth area for the information technology industry, but that further investment hinged on a more serious approach by state officials to rampant piracy.</p>
<p>&quot;Piracy is a cancer that could destroy the whole thing. The information technology industry will not flourish unless there is good return on investments,&quot; Microsoft Middle East General Manager Ahmad Chami said at the Gulf Information Technology Exhibition.</p>
<p>Analysts put the size of the computer market in the Middle East at $1.5 billion a year, and growing at 12 to 15 percent annually.</p>
<p>The U.S.-based Business Software Alliance estimates software makers lost $400 million to piracy in the Middle East in 1995, of which $100 million was in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Lebanon, Syria and Kuwait are also big violators.</p>
<p>Chami said Microsoft plans to invest in tailor-made products for the region by entering partnerships with Middle Eastern firms. A partnership agreement with a Saudi company will come into effect next year and others are planned, he said.</p>
<p>Chami declined to put a value on Microsoft's current and future investment in the Middle East, but said it invested more than $2 billion in research and development worldwide, most of which was in Internet and intranet applications.</p>
<p>Microsoft, which introduced the Arabic-language versions of its latest software programmes in September, said its first Arabic language Internet explorer would be launched soon.</p>
<p>Chami said Microsoft would urge governments in the region to address the &quot;harmful piracy issue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Through increased investments and local partnerships we hope to create awareness at government level,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have seen progress, especially in the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, but there is still much to be done elsewhere,&quot; he added. &quot;We expect to see fewer losses to piracy in the Gulf and mainly in the Saudi Arabia,&quot; Chami said.</p>
<p>He said manufacturers' figures show 350,000 PCs are shipped to the Middle East every year.</p>
