<headline>US lawmaker says working on encryption compromise.</headline>

<p>Senator Bob Kerrey said on Thursday he is crafting compromise legislation to resolve the heated debate over encryption export policy.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an urgent need to change the law,&quot; the Nebraska Democrat said a news briefing here. &quot;The market needs to develop and the market's going to be frustrated in trying to develop.&quot;</p>
<p>Encryption programs, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software &quot;key,&quot; have become a critical component of global communications and online commerce over the Internet.  </p>
<p>But the Clinton administration sharply restricts the exports of products containing encryption, maintaining that the spread of strong encryption would thwart government efforts to catch spies and criminals.</p>
<p>To qualify for export under the current policy, strong encryption products must contain features allowing the government to crack the codes by getting access to the software keys.</p>
<p>Software companies contend the export limits are stifling their business while civil libertarians complain the rules could lead to unwarranted government snooping.  </p>
<p>Several bills have already been introduced that would eliminate most of the export restrictions. But the bills have little chance of passage, Kerrey said.</p>
<p>Sen Kerrey said the new proposal would include some restriction on encryption, including possible import limits on encryption products produced outside of the United States.</p>
<p>But he emphasized that the restrictions would be aimed at outlawing the use of encryption in criminal activity, not commercial use of encryption.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to have as little commercial restriction as possible,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Kerrey said he presently has only the &quot;outline&quot; of the bill, to be called the Secure Public Network Act of 1997. &quot;A lot of the details have not been filled in,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kerrey said the goal in drafting the proposal would be to get the support of the Republican leadership and relevent committee chairman, including the Intelligence, Banking, Commerce and Judiciary chairmen. &quot;This baby's got to have a lot of parents,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Senate minority Leader Tom Daschle added his support to Kerrey's efforts.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have to make the Internet more secure and we have to ensure that security is something that becomes commonplace,&quot; Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, said at the briefing. &quot;I would like to see us resolve this matter in this session of Congress, before the end of this year.&quot;</p>
<p>The Clinton administration was preparing its own legislation on encryption, but a draft of the proposal was sharply criticized by privacy advocates and industry groups.</p>
<p>Some said the legislation would have expanded the government's authority to listen to private communications without a warrant.</p>
<p>Kerrey said he would not support such a provision. &quot;It's a bad idea,&quot; he said. &quot;I think that was a legitimate concern expressed by opponents.&quot;</p>
