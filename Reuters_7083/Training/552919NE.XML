<p>Inference Corp Thursday said it expects to report a loss in the range of $1.0 million to $1.3 million or approximately $0.12 to $0.16 a share.</p>
<p>In a statement, the company said revenues for the quarter ended April 30, are expected to be in the range of $6.7 million to $7.1 million. Product revenues for the first quarter are expected to be in the range of $3.1 million to $3.3 million, and service revenues are expected to be in the range of $3.6 million to $3.8 million.  </p>
<p>For the quarter ended April 30, 1996, the company reported revenues of $9.1 million, and net income of $0.8 million or $.09 per share. Product revenues for the first quarter last year were $5.0 million, and services revenues were $4.1 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The Company is going through a transition in the way we market and offer our products,&quot; said Peter Tierney, chairman, president and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>&quot;Internationally, where we have a strong dependency, we experienced a significant revenue short-fall that dramatically impacted our entire business,&quot; he added. &quot;While we have seen some improvement domestically, we still have much to do to improve our ability to execute in the sales and marketing of our products, both domestically and internationally.&quot;</p>
