<p>The market for initial public offerings will continue to be marked by selectivity this week as investors pick and choose their way into deals that offer attractive valuations and solid earnings prospects.</p>
<p>In tandem with this trend, analysts said, choppy markets favouring big-cap stocks were nudging IPO investors into seeking out deals of bigger companies that afforded credibility and liquidity.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a liquidity-driven market,&quot; said William Schreier, managing director of equity capital markets at Salomon Brothers. Investors would rather &quot;have a big liquid name to trade than a small company which is probably not going to be as liquid as they might like.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Heavy-cap deals are in play right now,&quot; agreed John Fitzgibbon, editor of the IPO Aftermarket. &quot;The market wants better names, bigger companies&quot;.</p>
<p>Last  week, as the market stayed focused on blue-chip stocks, IPOs received a generally tepid response, compelling some companies to slash terms.</p>
<p>Analysts see another round of price cuts over the next week or so. &quot;It takes us to a low point after a round of price cuts when the elastic band will snap back,&quot; said David Menlow, president of Springfield, N.J.-based IPO Financial Network Corp.</p>
<p>For this week, the calendar looks fairly busy, but &quot;there are no moonshots,&quot; said Fitzgibbon.</p>
<p>Some deals, notably the bigger or more recognisable ones, show promise, analysts said.</p>
<p>One deal they like is NACT Telecommunications Inc. , a unit of Vancouver, Wash.-based GST Telecommunications Inc.</p>
<p>NACT provides advanced telecommunications switching platforms with integrated applications software and network telemanagement capabilities. The three million share offering is being lead-managed by Hambrecht &amp; Quist, and is expected to price between a range of $10 to $12 a share.</p>
<p>Fitzgibbon sees a one to 1-1/2 point rise, or possibly higher, at its debut.</p>
<p>Cantor Fitzgerald's Vincent Slavin said he liked  IONA Technologies Ltd , a Dublin, Ireland-based provider of software products used in network-based applications in multi-platform computing environments.</p>
<p>Slavin sees a rise of &quot;several points in the aftermarket&quot;. &quot;There is very strong demand for the deal,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The deal, lead-managed by Lehman Brothers, consists of 7,647,900 American Depositary Shares, of which 6,117,520 ADSs will be offered in the United States and Canada. The price range is $14.50 to $16.50.</p>
<p>Analysts said Culbro Corp. spinoff General Cigar Corp. could also fare well. &quot;The short-term fundamentals are strong,&quot; said Mark Basham, investment officer at Standard &amp; Poor's. &quot;There's a huge backlog for premium cigars&quot;.</p>
<p>He said the company's heavy exposure in the premium segment could allow it to perform better than its rival cigar makers Consolidated Cigar Holdings Inc. and Swisher International Group Inc. , both of which went public last year.</p>
<p>General Cigar, which is offering six million shares in a range of $14 to $16 each, sells the two top-selling premium cigars in the United States, Macanudo and Partagas, as well as other brands. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette are lead underwriters on the IPO.</p>
<p>But Steven Tuen, analyst at IPO Value Monitor, said he is &quot;fairly neutral&quot; on the deal: &quot;Cigar smoking is still a fad.... We're not sure when that's going to stop,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Special Metals Inc. , producer of superalloy and special alloy products, could also pick up a premium of about a point at its debut, analysts said. The company is offering 3.7 million shares at $15 to $17 a share in a deal led by Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>Other deals set to come to market this week include European telecommunications carrier Esprit Telecom Group Plc , integrated software provider Deltek Systems Inc. and time share operator Vistana Inc. .</p>
