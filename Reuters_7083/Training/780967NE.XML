<title>USA: Microsoft to pay patent fee to Apple.</title>
<headline>Microsoft to pay patent fee to Apple.</headline>
<text>
<p>BOSTON, Aug 6, Reuter - Apple Computer Inc chief financial officer Fred Anderson said that Microsoft Corp will pay Apple a non-disclosed sum, in addition to its previously-announced $150 million investment, as part of its sweeping patent cross-licensing agreement with Apple.</p>
<p>Anderson said that under terms of the agreement he could not be more specific about the amount, which is in addition to the $150 million Microsoft will spend to purchase preferred non-voting Apple shares.  </p>
<p>Anderson said Apple will not recognize the entire payment in one quarter, but will spread out the cash payment as income over a few years.</p>
<p>&quot;The payment is one way,&quot; Anderson told reporters at a press conference concerning its deal with Microsoft. &quot;We have a license to their patent portfolio and they have a license to our patent portfolio,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Anderson also said Apple hopes to add a few more board members, because the company has slots for an additional three.  </p>
<p>With the resignations of all but two Apple board members earlier Wednesday and the addition of four new board members, Apple now has six board members.</p>
<p>&quot;The changes bring us to six,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;I think it would be very good if we had someone from education on the board. One could argue that you could also have someone from a consumer marketing background. We will probably add some new board members.&quot; The new board members will be compensated in stock.</p>
<p>Anderson said the board members who resigned did so because they saw it in the best interest of the company.  </p>
<p>Anderson said Apple hopes the new board members, including well-known industry executives, will help Apple draw the interest of a &quot;world-class CEO.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some of these executives have been involved in major corporate turnarounds,&quot; Anderson said. Jerry York, for example, was hand picked by CEO Louis Gerstner at International Business Machines Corp in 1993 to help him turn around the money-losing computer giant, which included a massive write-off and hefty layoffs. Anderson added though, that Apple does not have any plans for further layoffs at this time.  </p>
<p>Anderson said that with new board members in place, Apple hopes to move full speed ahead in its search for a CEO to succeed Gil Amelio, who was ousted by the board last month.</p>
<p>&quot;John Thompson (the executive at the search firm Heidrick &amp; Struggles) has a list of candidates,&quot; Anderson said, adding Apple had decided Thompson should not pursue the candidates until Wednesday's announcements. &quot;I know expect John Thompson to be aggressively pursuing these candidates. I'd hope that within the next three months, we'd have a new CEO.&quot;</p>
