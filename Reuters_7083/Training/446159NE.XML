<title>USA: Intel shares skid on competitive worries.</title>
<headline>Intel shares skid on competitive worries.</headline>
<dateline>PALO ALTO, Calif. 1997-03-17</dateline>

<p>Shares of Intel Corp. slumped in heavy volume at midday on concerns over rivals' competitive products and the overall level of stock market valuations, analysts said.</p>
<p>By early afternoon, the share had tumbled as much as six points to 131-7/8 as the stock led the Nasdaq most actives list with volume topping 11 million shares.</p>
<p>Earlier, Maynard, Mass.-based Digital Equipment Corp said it will offer low-cost versions of its Alpha chip designed to run on high-end personal computers that it said would outperform Intel's top-end Pentium Pro processors.  </p>
<p>Digital said the chips, ranging from 400 to 533 megahertz and in price from $295 to $495 in quantities of 1,000, was co-designed with Mitsubishi Electric Corp and would be marketed by the two companies and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for use with Microsoft's Windows NT.</p>
<p>Analysts said the news, combined with aggressive marketing by Advanced Micro Devices of its new K6 chip were weighing on Intel shares, but they said the actual threat from the rivals was unlikely to do much to dent Intel's commanding lead in the microprocessor market.</p>
<p>David Wu, an analyst at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp, noted the market, especially technologgy shares, were weaker overall.  </p>
<p>Earlier, analysts cited cautious comments by investor Warren Buffet in his annual letter to shareholders of Berkeshire Hathaway Inc, as triggering a dip in stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;If you were nervous about the market, would you own technology stocks?&quot; asked Wu. &quot;The big issue in investors' minds is that we forgot about AMD and Cyrix (Corp ) as competitors for about about a year.&quot;</p>
<p>Cyrix recently launched a new microprocessor which Compaq Computer Corp said it will put in a low-cost computer selling at less than $1,000.  </p>
<p>But Wu added he does not expect any of the new chips to do much to disrupt Intel's commanding lead in the microprocessor market. Intel supplies more than 80 percent of microprocessors used in personal computers and PC-based desktops and servers.</p>
<p>For example, Wu said, he expects Digital's new lower-priced Alpha chips to sell in relatively limited volumes and be marketed mostly in the workstation replacement market.</p>
<p>Wu said he does not expect most major software makers to port over their software to the Alpha-NT platform.</p>
<p>Digital's biggest opportunity for the Alpha was when the speedy chip first came on the market five years ago, he said.</p>
<p>Wu noted Intel has a lot due from its laboratories, including new Pentium II shipping in May, a high performance quarter micron shrunk version of Pentium II in the fourth quarter and an MMX-enhanced Pentium II in the second quarter of next year and a chip codenamed Willamette late in 1998.</p>
<p>Wu said he expects Intel to exceed his current earnings per share estimate of $2.09 in the first quarter, possibly posting a figure as high as $2.15.</p>
<p>Wall Street expects Intel's per-share earnings to be $2.06, according to mean estimates compiled by First Call.</p>
