<p>Israel's Tecnomatix Technologies Ltd, a software maker for computer-aided production engineering, is looking to expand beyond its base in the automotive industry, the company's general manager for North American operations said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The executive, Dan Fish, said in a Reuters interview that Tecnomatix wanted to move increasingly into such areas as aerospace and heavy industry while still expanding in the automobile field. About 70 percent of its revenues come from the automobile industry.  </p>
<p>&quot;The strategy is to continue the penetration of (the) automobile industry and add those resources to those (other) industries,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This focus on aerospace and heavy equipment is one of the keys to making sure we do grow the business.&quot;</p>
<p>According to analysts, Tecnomatix is a world leader in the field of computer-aided production engineering software. The tools automate the design of the assembly process before actual production begins, thus cutting costs and increasing efficiency.  </p>
<p>Tecnomatix had revenues of $44 million last year. About half came from Europe, a third from North America and the rest from East Asia.</p>
<p>U.S. revenues were $15.7 million last year, a 19 percent increase over 1995. &quot;We've had some pretty strong growth and ... the company is positioning itself for continued growth,&quot; Fish said.</p>
<p>He said Tecnomatix was accustomed to seeing revenues from customers increase by &quot;orders of magnitude&quot; as they switched from pilot projects using company software to full-scale production with the tools.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're trying to leverage this model in aerospace and heavy industry,&quot; for such goods as earth-moving equipment and shipbuilding, he said.</p>
<p>Tecnomatix has its U.S. headquarters in Novi, Michigan, and offices in Seattle and Chicago. It has plans for a fourth office at a site to be announced.</p>
<p>Its product development staff in San Jose, California, recently expanded to 29, an indication of expected increased demand, Fish said.</p>
<p>Tecnomatix in recent months has signed a $10 million contract with Japan's Mazda Motor Corp and a $6.8 million contract with Ford Motor Co, which the company has said could provide total revenues of $30 million through 1999.</p>
<p>Tecnomatix American Depositary Receipts were up two points at 33-3/4 Wednesday in heavy trading.</p>
