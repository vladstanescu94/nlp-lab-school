<p>Spyglass Inc. said Tuesday it has closed its office in Champaign, Ill., where the maker of Internet-related software was founded and was offering buy-out packages or relocation to some 35 employees.</p>
<p>Spyglass said the closure on Monday was part of its move away from the Internet browser market and into the market for embedded software, which is installed into appliances and products such as photocopiers and cellular telephones.</p>
<p>In December, Spyglass said it would focus on providing software to link non-PC appliances to each other or the World Wide Web using Internet technology.</p>
<p>Spyglass, based in Naperville, Ill., has a total of about 200 employees. It has offices in Cambridge, Mass., Los Altos, Calif., London and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Spyglass spokesman Randy Pitzer said the closure of the leased office will not affect earnings significantly.</p>
<p>The 35 employees, mainly engineers and software developers, may apply for positions at the company's three other U.S. facilities but are not guaranteed new jobs, Pitzer said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're positioning this as a redeployment of our resources,&quot; Pitzer said. &quot;Even if these people don't come with us, we still will increase the number of people in product development.&quot;</p>
<p>Pitzer said there were currently more than enough positions open in Spyglass to absorb the 35 Champaign employees, and the company was planning on increasing its total headcount throughout the year.</p>
<p>Rick Berry, an analyst for investment bankers Murphey, Marseilles, Smith &amp; Nammack, said the closure was logical, given the company's first-quarter loss caused partly by its investment in the device market.</p>
<p>&quot;It's probably another step in their evolution,&quot; he said, adding it also shows the company is &quot;consolidating to get their costs under control&quot;.</p>
<p>In its first quarter ended Dec. 31, Spyglass reported a net loss of $1.5 million, or 12 cents a share, compared with a profit of $842,000, or 7 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Spyglass got its start in 1990 licensing software developed at the National Centre for Supercomputing at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana.</p>
<p>Pitzer noted that the company will maintain its financial and technological relationship with the university despite the closure, and still plans to recruit its graduates.</p>
<p>&quot;That's how we got our start,&quot; Pitzer said.</p>
<p>Spyglass' stock was 6 cents lower at $9.06 on Nasdaq in afternoon trading.</p>
