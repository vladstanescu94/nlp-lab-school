<headline>Micro Warehouse faces class action suit.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Micro Warehouse Inc shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against the company, alleging Micro Warehouse misrepresented material information about its financial statements, the plaintiff's lawyers said.</p>
<p>The lawyers said in a statement the suit was filed on behalf of holders who had purchased Micro Warehouse stock between March 26, 1995 and September 27, 1996. They said it charged the company and two of its officers with violations of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act.  </p>
<p>Micro Warehouse, which was not immediately available to comment on the lawsuit, said on Monday it was likely to restate its financial results for 1994 and 1995 fiscal years after finding errors in accounting procedures.</p>
<p>The company said then it had not determined the charge from these errors but believed it would total about $18 million after tax.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the issuance of a series of false and misleading financial statements, the price of Micro Warehouse stock was artificially inflated during the Class Period,&quot; the lawyers said in the statement.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs were represented by the law firms of Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach LLP, Schatz &amp; Nobel, P.C. and Hurwitz &amp; Sagarin, P.C., among others.</p>
