<title>USA: Software focus of U.S.-China trade meeting.</title>

<p>U.S.-China meetings are likely to touch this week on all points of trade friction between them, but a key focus will be on software, Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Two days of meetings open on Thursday and include announcements by Kantor and Chinese Trade Minister Wu Yi of details of software contracts between U.S. firms and three Chinese agencies. Kantor said the contracts were a result of a June agreement on intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>The U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade also was to discuss establishing a title verification office in Beijing and additional copyright and trademark training.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not anticipate any dramatic breakthroughs outside of our ability to continue this process,&quot; Kantor told reporters, citing software sales and agreement on commercial law as &quot;important items.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Remember, we're building a normal and, hopefully, productive trade relationship which will be reciprocal in nature with China,&quot; Kantor said.</p>
<p>While the commission would focus on 10 business sectors, Kantor said he and Wu could use a private meeting to &quot;raise a number of issues that will cover the waterfront of trade&quot; between them. China's desire to join the World Trade Organisation -- and U.S. reservations -- was a likely topic.</p>
<p>Kantor said he would raise several market access issues, including rules that virtually cut off U.S. wheat sales. Wu might want to discuss textile exports, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I would assume we would discuss this and exchange our views,&quot; Kantor said of the textile trade.</p>
<p>China is the fifth largest U.S. trade partner and sells far more than it buys. The U.S. trade deficit with China was $33.8 billion in 1995 and totalled $18.5 billion at the end of July.</p>
<p>Kantor said the U.S.-China trade deficit &quot;is growing, and growing as a result of concerns about market access that I have mentioned.&quot;</p>
