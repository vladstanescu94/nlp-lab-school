<p>Technology stocks rose Wednesday on a growing belief that recent price-cutting has spurred holiday personal computer sales as money managers loaded up on stocks to dress up their portfolios at year-end.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts said the rally was sparked by positive comments from a Soundview analyst about Compaq Computer Corp., and waning fears that the holiday sales season would be a dismal one for makers of PCs for consumers.</p>
<p>Soundview Financial analyst Mark Specker upgraded his short-term rating on Compaq to buy from hold and continued to recommend buying the stock for long-term gains.</p>
<p>His recommendations on technology stocks hold strong sway among institutional investors.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm swept up other PC makers like Dell Computer Corp. and spilled over to other top technology names.</p>
<p>Compaq rose $6.375 to $78.625 on Nasdaq while International Business Machines Corp. added $6.75 to $158.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Leading Nasdaq's most actives was Intel Corp., which added $5.75 to $135.75, Dell, up $3.125 to $56.50 and Microsoft Corp., which gained $2.75 to $82.625.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite index, laden with technology stocks, jumped 19.06 points to 1,285.38, a gain of 1.5 percent compared with a rise of 0.6 percent for the Dow Jones industrial average.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like they're going after the group again,&quot; said one trader, pointing in particular to Compaq, Intel and IBM.</p>
<p>&quot;They are just buying the techs in a dramatic way again,&quot; agreed another trader. &quot;The PC scare isn't what they thought it would be,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Both IBM and Intel shares had reached 52-week highs in recent weeks, only to fall back in end-of-year profit-taking and a broader market downturn.</p>
<p>Peter Jenkins, director of global stock trading at Scudder Stevens &amp; Clark said, &quot;It's a group move ... we're coming to the end of the year and these are big (institutional) holdings.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;IBM and Intel, I think have sold here over last couple of weeks, and whatever had to be done has been done,&quot; he said, which laid the groundwork for institutional buyers to add to their holdings.</p>
<p>&quot;All (these) stocks are in a year-end window-dressing rally,&quot; said Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management, who concurred that several of these stocks had been oversold in recent weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;IBM is the one all the money managers want in their portfolios,&quot; Orlando said, referring to the desire to put the best face on their end-of-year report cards by which investors judge a fund's relative performance.</p>
