<p>Netscape Communications and Forte Software Inc said they have reached an agreement to work together to help customers develop high-performance applications that can work with the Internet.</p>
<p>They will enable developers to rapidly build applications using Internet technologies for so-called Intranets and Extranets without writing software code.</p>
<p>Intranets are internal corporate networks based on Internet technology and Extranets are a growing class of applications that can connect companies with suppliers and customers, for example, over the public Internet.  </p>
<p>The two companies said they have already begun work on creating seamless access between services offered within Forte's products and an interface to Netscape's recently announced Visual JavaScript, a programming tool developers can use to build applications designed to run across networks.</p>
<p>Netscape has dubbed this family of programs &quot;crossware&quot; and the company said it will be a good mechanism for customers to take advantage of the distributed functionality of Forte applictions, including its object-oriented tools.</p>
<p>Object-oriented software enables developers to use and reuse prewritten software, or objects, in constructing programs to simply and reduce the cost of programming.</p>
<p>Earlier, VASCO Corp  VASC.O said it had signed an agreement with Netscape to bundle Netscape's SuiteSpot integrated server software suite with VASCO's suite of Internet security products.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, VASCO said it and Netscape will jointly market the products through the Netscape Affiliate Plus Value Added Resellers (VARS) worldwide program.</p>
