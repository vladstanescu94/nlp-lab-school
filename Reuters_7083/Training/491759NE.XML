<p>MetaTools Inc said Monday it expects earnings per share for the first quarter to range from nil to $0.01, on net revenues of $6.1-$6.2 million.</p>
<p>The company earned $0.06 per share on revenues of $5.5 million in the first quarter of 1996.  </p>
<p>Analysts on average have expected first quarter earnings to be $0.05, according to First Call.</p>
<p>The company also said it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Specular International, a privately-held software development company, and expected to take a second quarter charge of about $7 million related to the transaction.</p>
<p>It said it planned to issue the number of shares of its common stock equal to $5,451,000 divided by the average closing price of its stock 20 days prior to the close of the transaction, plus $1 million, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Specular.  </p>
<p>Commenting on its results, the company said it expects slower growth in the first quarter of 1997 compared with 1996 due to the delay in the expected shipment of the OEM version of its new consumer digital photo product, &quot;Kai's Photo Soap,&quot; to the second quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>The general weakness in the domestic retail software market for graphics products and expected increased operating expenses from the acquisition of Real Time Geometry in December 1996 contributed to lower earnings, the company said.</p>
<p>The company also said that, as previously announced, its proposed merger with Fractal Design Corp is expected to be submitted to a shareholder vote before the end of May.</p>
<p>The companies announced in February their decision to come together in a deal worth about $145 million.</p>
