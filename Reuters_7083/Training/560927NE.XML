<p>Software manufacturer SAP AG, whose dizzying ascent on the German bourse has made it one of the market's most popular stocks, blotted its copybook on Monday as it emerged at the centre of an insider trading probe.</p>
<p>Armed with a list of names of suspected offenders, Frankfurt prosecutors said they were investigating allegations that a large group of SAP staff and associates dealt illegally in its shares in a phase of extreme price volatility last year.</p>
<p>The probe concerned more than 100 individuals in its early stages, a spokesman for Germany's stock market watchdog told Reuters, and could become the most serious case since insider trading was criminalised here in 1994.</p>
<p>Investors showed their disapproval by sending SAP's DAX-listed preferred shares plummeting as much as five percent in early trade on Monday, but the shares regained ground in a booming bourse session and closed up 3.10 marks at 324.50, a rise which still lagged clearly behind the broader market.</p>
<p>Some dealers said the often-volatile SAP might face more pressure once the U.K. market reopens on Tuesday although this would probably be short-lived. While any potential cost resulting from the probe is likely to be limited, some investors could be put off by a perceived breach of faith.</p>
<p>&quot;This does have an impact on sentiment, at least in the short term. After all people don't like to think of prosecutors in the boardroom,&quot; said Josh Waiblinger, assistant vice president of equities at Frankfurt's BHF Bank.</p>
<p>But if its past is anything to go by, SAP, whose R/3 business software is used to keep track of purchasing, manufacturing and sales data, will bounce back fast.</p>
<p>SAP's stock market record has been meteoric -- it has tripled in value since early 1995, when news that its was to join the DAX fanned a flurry of buy interest.</p>
<p>The biggest blip, and the focus of the insider probe, came after news last October of an unexpected slowdown in third quarter growth. That news slashed SAP's shares by a quarter, although they have risen to new record highs since.</p>
<p>The Federal Securities Trading Supervisory Authority, the BAWe, the linchpin of Germany's crackdown on insider deals, began an investigation into the price drop and found enough evidence to pass on the case to the prosecution office.</p>
<p>&quot;The investigation is looking at the use of insider information in the trading of shares,&quot; prosecution spokesman Job Tilmann said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is probably the most serious case we have seen here,&quot; said BAWe spokesman Juergen Oberfrank.</p>
<p>The BAWe said over 100 &quot;primary and secondary insiders&quot; were named in the initial probe -- the first category implies staff at SAP and banks and the second their relatives or friends -- making it one of the largest it has ever handled.</p>
<p>&quot;But we expect that this number will fall as time goes by,&quot; Oberfrank added.</p>
<p>&quot;We provided documents for the BAWe back in October,&quot; an SAP spokesman confirmed. The company is expected to address the matter at its shareholder meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Insider dealing was outlawed in Germany in 1994 as part of a drive to clean up the financial markets and make them more attractive to international investors.</p>
<p>The maximum punishment for insider trading here is five years in jail, but so far authorities have stuck to fines.</p>
<p>This year saw Germany impose its toughest penalty yet for the offence, with a single fine of 3.6 million marks in total, of which one million marks ($579,000) had to be paid immediately and the rest is suspended pending a probation period.</p>
<p>The BAWe has been continually stepping up its fight against insider activity since it began operations with a handful of staff in 1995.</p>
<p>Now with some 100 employees and an electronic system which allows it to monitor around 400,000 trades taking place in Germany daily, it believes its teething problems are over.</p>
<p>The BAWe passed on 11 cases to prosecutors in the first quarter of 1997, compared with seven for the whole of 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not that there are more black sheep out there, it is more a question of our technical capacity,&quot; said Oberfrank.</p>
<p>The initial probe into SAP could be completed in a month, according to public prosecutors but the case will likely drag on for considerably longer, should it go to court.</p>
