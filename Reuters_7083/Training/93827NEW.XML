<headline>AT&amp;T, Microsoft in Internet deal.</headline>

<p>Telecommunications giant AT&amp;T Corp. and software superpower Microsoft Corp. teamed up Thursday to package each other's Internet products, giving Microsoft a leg up in its Web browser battle with Netscape Communications Corp.</p>
<p>Personal computer users who have Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system will get the Redmond, Wash., company's Internet Explorer 3.0 when they sign up for AT&amp;T's Internet access service, AT&amp;T WorldNet Service, the companies said.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T said it designated Internet Explorer 3.0, the latest version of Microsoft's software for accessing the Web, as the default browser for WorldNet.</p>
<p>Before Thursday, AT&amp;T had offered Netscape Navigator as the sole browser software for WorldNet. AT&amp;T will still offer Navigator, but customers will have to specify it when ordering the Internet service.</p>
<p>The move was seen as yet another blow to Mountain View, Calif.-based Netscape, which has asked the Justice Department to investigate Microsoft's Internet marketing tactics and whether they violate the software giant's 1994 consent decree with the department.</p>
<p>Netscape stock dropped $3 to $45 on the Nasdaq.</p>
<p>Asked if Microsoft had any qualms about announcing yet another deal with an online access provider in light of yet another Justice Department probe, a company vice president, Brad Chase, said he did not know any details of the investigation.</p>
<p>&quot;To my knowledge that is not what they are investigating at all, and I don't know any of the details at all,&quot; Chase said in a conference call with reporters. &quot;It's sad that our competitors are seeking government intervention ... We are very proud of the progress we have made.&quot;</p>
<p>Chase, a general manager in Microsoft's Internet division, pointed out that Internet Explorer's market share has doubled since the company unveiled Version 3.0 six weeks ago, jumping from 5-10 percent of the market, to 10-20 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very excited about the continued momentum in the downloads (of the software from Web sites) we have had,&quot; Chase said. &quot;We are pretty pumped up.&quot;</p>
<p>He hinted at more deals with other online services and Internet access services but declined to be specific. &quot;We do have a relationship with other access providers, but I don't want to make any announcements today,&quot; Chase said.</p>
<p>Industry sources said the Prodigy Services Co. online service is expected to announce a similar deal next week. A Prodigy spokesman at the service's headquarters in White Plains, N.Y., declined to comment.</p>
<p>As part of its deal with AT&amp;T, Microsoft will offer WorldNet software bundled with Windows 95, and WorldNet will appear as an icon in the software's online services folder when users start up their new PCs.</p>
<p>Most computers with Windows 95 delivered during the upcoming holiday season were expected to include WorldNet.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T stands to benefit from that part of the deal. Although the New York-based company has long been a major power in long-distance phone and other telecommunications, it is relatively new in the Net access business and, with 425,000 WorldNet subscribers, lags behind big online services like America Online Inc. with 6.2 million.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T WorldNet Vice President Tom Evslin said his company selected Internet Explorer as its primary Web browser instead of Netscape because of requests from its customers following many positive reviews. &quot;We are giving customers a choice,&quot; Evslin said.</p>
<p>He said AT&amp;T was also impressed by Microsoft's promise to give customers free upgrades of its browser software &quot;forever.&quot;</p>
<p>Microsoft said it expected shortly to begin beta, or final customer testing, of versions of Internet Explorer 3.0 for the Macintosh and Windows 3.1 operating systems.</p>
<p>Some analysts pointed out that even as Microsoft makes inroads in the browser market, Netscape still retains a dominant, growing stake in the arena for Internet server software, which functions as printing press and warehouse for Web pages.</p>
<p>&quot;Microsoft has been pretty aggressive about going after every partner Netscape has,&quot; said Steve Harmon, senior investment analyst at MecklerMedia Internet Consulting. But he pointed out that the browser, or client, software is just the front door to the server software -- which is generating revenues.</p>
<p>&quot;Netscape is the leader in server software,&quot; Harmon said. &quot;While the client wanes, the server market is going strong.&quot;</p>
