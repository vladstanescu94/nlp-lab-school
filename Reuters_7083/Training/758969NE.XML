<title>USA: McAfee comfortable with Q3 estimates.</title>
<headline>McAfee comfortable with Q3 estimates.</headline>

<p>McAfee Associates Inc executives said they were comfortable with analysts' earnings and revenue estimates for the third quarter, when they expect days' sales outstanding to peak.</p>
<p>McAfee Chief Financial Officer Prabhat Goyal told reporters after the company presented to investors at a Robertson Stephens &amp; Co conference here that the company is comfortable with Wall Street third quarter earnings per share estimates of $0.44 and  revenue estimates of $87 million.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, he said the company's days of sales outstanding -- an indication of how quickly customers are paying for products -- would rise to the &quot;low seventies&quot; in the third quarter.</p>
<p>An increase in days' sales outstanding among software companies has rattled Wall Street recently, although some analysts note that in McAfee's case it also reflects the company's effort to sell products at higher price points to large customers, extending the sales cycle.  </p>
<p>McAfee Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Larson said the company expects the days' sales outstanding number -- which rose to 62 days in the second quarter from 44 in the first -- to decline after the third quarter.</p>
<p>Goyal said operating margins were not going to be &quot;dramatically lower&quot; in the third quarter than the 42 percent the company reported in the second quarter, partly due to a lack of advertising spending in August.</p>
<p>Operating margins were 41.1 percent in the first quarter and the company's model continues to target operating margins in the high 30s to low 40s percentages.  </p>
<p>In North America, indirect sales were 44 percent of the company's business in the most recently completed quarter, compared with 39 percent in the previous quarter and low 30 percent levels prior to that.</p>
<p>Larson declined direct comment on a pending lawsuit brought by rival Symantec, which alleges McAfee copied certain software code.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to ship the product and I think that speaks volumes about whether we think there will be damages,&quot; Larson said, adding McAfee would not be shipping product if it thought it was infringing.</p>
