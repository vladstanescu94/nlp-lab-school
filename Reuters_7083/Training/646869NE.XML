<p>Microsoft Corp chairman Bill Gates said on Monday the Internet global computer network was so big and attracting so much investment it would keep growing and overcome its current drawbacks.</p>
<p>Gates told delegates at a telecommunications conference the Internet had several temporary limitations, including lack of security and some capacity problems.</p>
<p>&quot;These limitations do exist but there are so many companies, including my own, that are hard at work to eliminate these limitations, that I have no doubt the Internet would continue to charge ahead,&quot; Gates said via teleconference.</p>
<p>&quot;The level of investment, particularly in the U.S., but also around the world, is quite amazing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt the critical mass has been achieved.&quot;</p>
<p>Gates said the Internet would transform global communications in ways currently not thought of.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the most important thing to happen for the communications world since the development of the first personal computer, over 16 years ago,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gates said the fastest area of growth was in Asia.</p>
<p>&quot;In Asia only two percent of homes have PCs, however, over 12 million PCs were sold in Asia over the last year, and it is the fastest growing market for computers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is also the fastest growing market for the Internet with over three million users now connected up, and every two years we expect that to more than double,&quot; Gates said.</p>
<p>It said that as the Internet grew the applications available for its use would multiply with video and audio communications becoming commonplace, first among businesses and eventually in the home.</p>
<p>&quot;Someday kids will spend more time on a PC connected to the Internet than in front of the TV,&quot; he said. &quot;It will be a much richer experience.&quot;</p>
