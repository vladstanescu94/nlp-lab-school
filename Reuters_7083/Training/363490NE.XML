<headline>Policy Management says suit verdict mixed.</headline>
<dateline>COLUMBIA, S.C. 1997-02-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Policy Management Systems Corp said Friday that a jury in Denver, Colo., has issued a mixed verdict in connection with a lawsuit brought against it by Security Life of Denver Insurance Co.</p>
<p>In a statement, Policy Management said the jury returned a verdict of $3.5 million against it, which it may contest.</p>
<p>The company said the jury at the same time found that Security Life was still using Policy Management's systems to process life insurance and that Security Life was responsible for &quot;knowingly misappropriating PMSC's trade secrets.&quot;  </p>
<p>Policy Management also said the court and the jury entered judgments in its favor and against Security Life's claims of fraud and unfair trade practices.</p>
<p>The company said the facts presented at the trial do not support the verdict for breach of contract or the award of any damages and may apply for post trial relief and, if necessary, appeal to the U.S. court of appeals.</p>
<p>Stephen Morrison, the company's general counsel, said the company feels somewhat vindicated by the verdict but is disappointed about the damage award.</p>
<p>Security Life could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Policy Management said it is currently reviewing the matter to determine what special charge impact, if any, the verdict may have on its 1996 financial results.</p>
<p>It said it was pursuing a claim against its own insurance carrier for coverage in the Security Life litigation.</p>
<p>Policy Management provides administrative services to property and casualty insurers.</p>
