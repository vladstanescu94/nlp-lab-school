<title>USA: Prosecutor charges Avant! in Cadence probe.</title>
<headline>Prosecutor charges Avant! in Cadence probe.</headline>
<dateline>SAN JOSE, Calif. 1997-04-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Santa Clara County, Calif., district attorney's office said Monday it filed felony charges against Avant! Corp, its president and other senior officials for allegedly stealing Cadence Design Systems Inc technology.</p>
<p>The district attorney alleged that Avant! and the co-defendants misappropriated Cadence Symbad, Froute, Groute, Qplace and Vsize technologies, and &quot;then used that stolen technology to develop and market competing products.&quot;  </p>
<p>Avant! and Cadence have been bitter rivals for years. They both sell software that helps engineers design the intricate layouts of computer chips.</p>
<p>For more than a year, Cadence has been pressing its own civil action against Avant!, alleging its rival stole some of its programming codes and used them in its own products.</p>
<p>All of the officials charged were former employees of Cadence Design Systems, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Santa Clara County prosecutors said they have filed felony charges of conspiracy and theft of trade secrets against Avant!, its president and director Gerald Hsu, vice president of engineering Tzyh-Lih Wuu, vice president of technology Yuh-Zen Liao, and director Yun-Chung Eric Cho.  </p>
<p>Charges were also filed against Avant! employee Chih-Liang Eric Cheng; director of business operations Shiaoli Leigh Huang; and Mitsuru Igusa, according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>In a statement issued late on Monday, Avant! denied the district attorney's allegations.</p>
<p>&quot;These charges are unfounded,&quot; Avant! president Hsu said in the statement. &quot;The district attorney's office has been misled and misinformed. We have faith in the legal system and confidently look forward to exoneration.&quot;  </p>
<p>Prosecutors said each defendant, if convicted, could receive a sentence of up to seven years in state prison. The defendants are expected to appear in San Jose Municipal Court on April 18 for arraignment.</p>
<p>The district attorney's office said the charges stemmed from a two-and-a-half year investigation by its high-technology crimes unit, which executed search warrants at Avant!'s headquarters and at the home of defendant Igusa.</p>
<p>Cadence welcomed news of the district attorney's charges, but declined Monday to comment on the impact it might have on its civil action against Avant! in federal court.  </p>
<p>&quot;Cadence, the victim of these charged crimes, is pleased that the District Attorney has decided to prosecute Avant!,&quot; Joe Costello, Cadence president and chief executive said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Cadence will continue to press its own civil action against Avant! in federal court, and looks forward to a prompt resolution of this matter.&quot;</p>
