<p>Creative Technology Ltd's shares soared Singapore $1.50 to a new year high of $21.80 after the multimedia company posted higher than expected net profits of US$44.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 1997.</p>
<p>The results, reported on Friday, surprised analysts. Several said they would be raising full year forecasts for the company.</p>
<p>&quot;We were generally surprised at the results,&quot; said Timothy Wong, research director at Vickers Ballas Investment Research Ltd. &quot;We will be revising upwards the earnings estimates.&quot;  </p>
<p>Wong said he revised Creative's earnings per share to S$2.22 from S$2.07 and his net profit forecast for the financial year ending June 30 S$203 million from US$185 million.</p>
<p>According to the Edinburgh Financial Publication's Estimate Directory, updated on April 24, Creative's 1997 net profit forecast averaged at US$109.1 million.</p>
<p>At 0115 GMT, the stock was trading around S$21.60, up S$1.30, or 6.40 percent, from Friday. Turnover was around 76,450 shares.  </p>
<p>Company officials had said the company expected gross margins to stay at a healthy 30 percent for the next five quarters and said the firm hoped to post 10-15 percent higher sales for the financial year ending June 1998.</p>
<p>They said performance would be based on its Sound Blaster cards and its digital video disk (DVD) drives.</p>
<p>Analysts were optimistic about its prospects.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is a fair assessment. The sound cards accounted for the imrpovement in their gross margins for the third quarter,&quot; Wong said. He said prospects for DVD looked promising too.  </p>
<p>About 60 percent of Creative's sale income now comes from its core audio business, 30 percent from multimeida upgrade kits and the balance from its other products such as DVD drives and internet products.</p>
