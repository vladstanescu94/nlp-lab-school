<p>Security Dynamics Technologies Inc Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Charles Stuckey said the company is comfortable with analysts' 1997 estimates and sees room for some upward movement in them.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel positive about it, and as a matter of fact the estimates that are out there could be adjusted up some,&quot; Stuckey said in a telephone interview from San Francisco, where he was attending the RSA Data Security Conference.</p>
<p>&quot;There's strong growth in the current base of products,&quot; he told Reuters, adding new products it was introducing should provide &quot;incremental upside over the next couple of years.&quot;  </p>
<p>The 1997 consensus of Wall Street estimates for Security Dynamics was $0.59 a share, with estimates ranging from $0.53 to $0.63, according to the First Call research service.</p>
<p>&quot;The biggest challenge, quite frankly, is time to market for us,&quot; Stuckey said. &quot;This whole area's moving so quickly that our challenge is to get to market faster.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of it we're going to have to see how we increase our development cycles and a lot of it is going to have to be done through partnerships and strategic alliances with other player because there's just no way one company, IBM or anybody else can do it all,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Bedford, Mass.-based Security Dynamics in July last year acquired RSA Data Security, which is a market leader in cryptographic toolkits, technology and services.</p>
<p>At the annual RSA conference, Security Dynamics outlined a strategy over the next three to four quarters of expanding on its current products with a new security server technology which will handle end-user authentification.</p>
<p>Security Dynamics has shipped more than one million of its patented SecurID tokens, which are used to identify computer users and verify they are authorized to gain access to certain systems.  </p>
<p>The new implementations will include enabling companies to manage their digital certificates internally and enhanced key management capabilities with new token technologies.</p>
<p>One example is a WebID product for authenticating users at specific Web pages, to enable certain data to be made available to specific individuals using SecurID products.</p>
<p>The company will also develop smart card technology, which will run its algorithms, mathematical formulae used to lock and unlock computer data and enable digital certificates and keys to be stored in a credit-card type format.  </p>
<p>Stuckey expects 1997 to be a year where companies begin building out their technical infrastructure for systems which will enable electronic commerce in the future, a process which he said could result in a greater product demand.</p>
<p>&quot;The true implementation, where you start seeing rollout of this, is probably going to occur in the 1998-99 time frame,&quot; he said. &quot;I think 1997 is the year where we'll see some early innovators running with this.&quot;</p>
<p>Stuckey said companies will need to test systems, run pilot programs and develop legal procedures and a corporate structure for dealing with new digital commerce technologies.  </p>
<p>Stuckey said demand for his company's products on both the traditional Security Dynamics business and RSA had been strong in 1996 and that it had come from diverse sectors of industry as well as a broad spread of geographical regions.</p>
<p>Security technologies are being embedded at a much faster rate than was apparent six months ago, he added, adding there were also a few positive signs the U.S. government is taking a deeper look into loosening its encryption policies.</p>
<p>&quot;Part of what we're seeing is some recognition, at least on the government's side, that there are significant issues in order to facilitate (electronic commerce),&quot; he said.</p>
