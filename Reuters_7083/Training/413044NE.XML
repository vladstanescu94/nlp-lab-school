<p>Reaching consumers through electronic mail, rather than luring them to a World Wide Web site, will be a key to success in doing business over the Internet, industry leaders said Friday.</p>
<p>Speaking at a Wharton business school technology seminar, Internet firm executives said advances in e-mail interactive capabilities and in targeting capabilities of marketing databases will make e-mail a preferred method of reaching customers.</p>
<p>&quot;E-mail has the ability to become a point-of-sale terminal...to become a purchase order,&quot; said Lee Stein, president of First Virtual Holdings Inc. &quot;E-mail is the killer app (application) for commerce on the Internet.&quot;</p>
<p>First Virtual, an electronic commerce company backed by major financial firms, has developed a payments system for Internet commerce, and has entered Internet marketing relationships with firms such as watchmaker Casio and Bell Atlantic Corp.</p>
<p>Stein said new &quot;HTML e-mail&quot; software allows users to send electronic mail with the graphics and interactive capabilities of World Wide Web pages. This will allow a marketer to place in an e-mail message an advertisement that also allows the user to place an order for the product, using First Virtual's &quot;Virtual PIN&quot; security identification code.</p>
<p>Through the transaction system developed by First Virtual, the sender of message could receive a commission for any order placed by the recipient. &quot;Everyone in the world can participate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Such messages can be sent through targeted mailing lists directly to consumer. They could also be included in e-mail sent in the course of business from one company to another, or even from one consumer to another.</p>
<p>Stein said he believed coming software &quot;filters&quot; will let users block indiscriminate electronic mail.</p>
<p>But it will also let consumers say what kinds of mail they will accept, which helps marketers. &quot;We figure 1998 becomes the year of the (e-mail) filter,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the e-mail concept is a much more efficient way of reaching customers than a World Wide Web site.</p>
<p>Other Internet industry leaders, speaking in a panel discussion, offered similar assessments of a shift in marketing emphasis toward targeting consumers directly.</p>
<p>Greg Shove, vice president for electronic commerce at America On-Line Inc., said direct marketing, &quot;might be horrfying...but it's what's working,&quot; as a business model for Internet companies</p>
<p>America On-Line's own product pitches, made to consumers as they sign on, &quot;are phenomenally successful,&quot; he said. &quot;They are a profit driver for the company.&quot;</p>
<p>The company's large subscriber base also makes it attractive for other firms to sell through it, he said. &quot;We have basically the information you need to develop one-to-one marketing.&quot;</p>
<p>A new America On-Line venture with Barnes &amp; Noble books illustrates ways in which commerce will evolve, he said.</p>
<p>The venture places immediate competitive pressure on existing Web bookseller Amazon. He said the two competitors will need to add value, and therefore charging for, their services as price competition increases.</p>
<p>They can do this by first, helping consumers make decisions by tracking their buying preferences, and second, helping publishers reach consumers with specific preferences, he said.</p>
<p>Lycos, producer of a &quot;search engine&quot; to find information on the Web, is also looking at ways to tailor its product to individual needs, said product development director Jeff Crown.</p>
<p>Crown said Lycos was on the verge of &quot;a major product relaunch,&quot; brought about by a large market study. He did not disclose the results of the study, but said it was aimed at &quot;providing a very useful guide to the Internet...a navigational centre.&quot;</p>
<p>Advertising would continue to play an important role, he said. &quot;The value of providing targeted content with a targeted ad or a targeted offer is significant.&quot;</p>
