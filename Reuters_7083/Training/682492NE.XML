<p>Despite better second-quarter operating results, Corel Corp remains on shaky ground as it branches out from battling Microsoft Corp for the office software market, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Corel said on Monday that excluding a previously announced US$113.7 million writedown for acquisition and development costs, it earned US$0.06 a share in the second quarter ended May 31.</p>
<p>After the writedown, Ottawa-based Corel lost US$1.49 a share versus a year earlier profit of US$0.01. Revenues jumped 15 percent to US$100.4 million from US$87.5 million.</p>
<p>Corel has taken on Microsoft's Word office software product with its WordPerfect, which it acquired from Novell Inc in January 1996.</p>
<p>Corel said that it had raised WordPerfect's market share to about 20 percent from 7 percent.</p>
<p>But analyst Steven Frankel at Adams Harkness in Boston said that &quot;this company still has not proven that the WordPerfect franchise can be turned into something that is both growing and profitable.&quot;</p>
<p>Another analyst, who requested anonymity, added: &quot;I think when it comes to taking market share from Microsoft, I think they can actually do some of that, although I'm not sure how profitable they can be.&quot;</p>
<p>Corel Chief Executive Michael Cowpland told a conference call on Tuesday that he expected WordPerfect sales would increase &quot;quite a bit&quot; as more suites were bundled with new computers over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>But analysts questioned Cowpland's move to branch out into other products. Corel is modifying WordPerfect to run on the program language Java, which can use any computer platform. It is also building inexpensive network computers without disc drives, to surf the Internet, and selling Internet video.</p>
<p>Cowpland said the network computers were scheduled to be in full production in October. He said Internet service providers were keen about renting them to potential customers since 60 percent of North American homes lacked personal computers.</p>
<p>The network computers would sell for US$700 each, with the laptop version at US$2,700.</p>
<p>Analyst Frankel said that &quot;last year there was a lot of excitement generated by their supposed foray into the video business. This year it's NCs (network computers) and Java and again, show me the money.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let's see it ship and generate revenue before I'm willing to sign on to it as the solution to the company's problems.&quot;</p>
