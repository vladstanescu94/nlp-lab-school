<p>1976</p>
<p>Steve Jobs sells his Volkswagen van and Stephen Wozniak sells his calculator and the two set up shop in the garage of Jobs' parents' home in Cupertino, Calif. Their first Apple computers feature wooden frames and appeal to hobbyists.</p>

<p>1984</p>
<p>Apple introduces its Macintosh computer in an ad during the Superbowl. The 60-second commercial airs just once but its image of an athletic woman bursting into a room of corporate drones and smashing an image of Big Brother crystalizes Apple's message as an alternative to IBM.</p>
<p>1985</p>
<p>In a stunning boardroom coup, Sculley ousts Jobs in an attempt to end a bitter split between those who believed in the Macintosh vs. those who supported the Apple II. Apple, facing losses, sets layoffs of 1,200 employees.</p>

<p>Apple introduces Newton, a hand-held computer that flops, and replaces Sculley with President Michael Spindler, who becomes CEO. It reports falling profits and sets layoffs of 2,500 workers, or 15 percent of its work force.</p>
<p>1994</p>
<p>Apple launches a new computer, the Power Macintosh, which uses a new microprocessor developed with IBM and Motorola. IBM reportedly makes a bid for Apple but is rebuffed.</p>
<p>1995</p>
<p>Apple launches a new line of laptop computers but is forced to recall them after two models burst into flames. While other computer markers are cashing in on the PC craze, a shortage of components keeps Apple customers waiting. Profits keep falling though sales rise to a record $3 billion.</p>
<p>January 1996</p>
<p>After posting a $69 million loss in the normally strong Christmas quarter, Apple sets 1,300 layoffs and its board decides to replace Spindler with director Gilbert Amelio, who had headed National Semiconductor Corp. Apple discusses merger with Sun Microsystems but talks break down over price.</p>

<p>March 1997</p>

<p>Aug. 6, 1997</p>
<p>Microsoft Corp. agrees to invest $150 million in Apple stock and develop more programmes for its Macintosh computers in a crucial sign of support for the struggling computer maker.</p>
