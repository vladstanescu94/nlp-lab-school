<p>Two software companies said on Wednesday they were negotiating to provide Internet providers with automatic Arabic translation software.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now negotiating with the Internet to give it our software package that allows automatic translation of Arabic, English, French and German.. we hope to have an agreement in 1997,&quot; Ahmed Azzedine, managing director of Paris-based Cimos company said.</p>
<p>He told Reuters in an interview the multi-lingual translation software was designed as a tool to help translators and &quot;not to replace a skilled human translation.&quot;</p>
<p>Omar Abdulhak, director of another Paris-based company Systran SA, said his firm was also contacting Internet providers for the same purpose and hoped to get his automatic translation system on the net during the first half of next year.</p>
<p>&quot;Our engineers are now working to put the automatic translator into Internet and it might be ready during the first half of 1997,&quot; Abdulhak said.</p>
<p>Both managers, in Damascus to attend a seminar on Arabisation and computers, said more interest in their programmes was shown by the West.</p>
<p>Abdulhak said his main clients were the United States government, NASA, and major U.S. and European companies such as Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale.</p>
<p>Azzedine, who established his company in 1977, said he went to Paris after failing to convince any Arab government to finance his project.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunaetly Arabs are not paying enough attention to translation. The West is more interested in investing to develop programmes on Arabic language than Arabs,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We can improve our current programme and reach a nearly perfect automatic Arabic translation in two years. I need six bright engineers with a budget of no more than $2.0 million to do this programme,&quot; he said.</p>
