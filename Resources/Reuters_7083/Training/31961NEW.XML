<p>A spokeswoman for News Corp Ltd in Japan on Wednesday denied a newspaper report which quoted chairman Rupert Murdoch as saying he was considering investing up to 100 billion yen ($917 million) in JSkyB.</p>
<p>JSkyB is a planned multi-channel digital satellite broadcasting service in Japan.</p>
<p>&quot;He did not say how much News Corp would invest in the project,&quot; the spokeswoman said, without elaborating.</p>
<p>The Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun reported on Tuesday that Murdoch told the newspaper's senior executives he was considering investing up to 100 billion yen in the venture.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said no one from News Corp at the meeting mentioned the possible amount of investment.</p>
<p>News Corp said earlier this year it would form a joint venture Japan's Softbank Corp to offer the JSkyB service.</p>
<p>Softbank said when it announced the establishment of the venture in June that the joint company would buy out Obunsha Media for 41.75 billion yen ($383 million). Obunsha has an equity stake of 21.4 percent in major television network Asahi National Broadcasting Co (TV Asahi).</p>
<p>The Asahi Shimbun group is the largest shareholder in TV Asahi, holding 38.3 percent stake in the broadcaster.</p>
<p>Murdoch and Softbank president Masayoshi Son held talks with a top official of Japan's Posts and Telecommunications Ministry on Tuesday about the planned satellite broadcasting service.</p>
<p>They told the head of the ministry's Broadcasting Bureau they would like to start a service as soon as possible, a ministry official told reporters.</p>
<p>The official said the firms would be granted a licence for a TV service using the JCSAT-3 satellite this autumn. They would be able to start services as early as next year, he said. ($1=109 yen)</p>
