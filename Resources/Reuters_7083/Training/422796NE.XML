<p>Fourth Shift Corp said Friday it expects to report an operating loss for its first quarter ended March 31, 1997 due to lower than expected revenues.</p>
<p>The company said that reported License Revenue for January and February 1997 have come in below expectations and although management expects an improved March, it does not anticipate that it will be able to offset the reduced revenue generated in January and February with March revenue.  </p>
<p>Fourth Shift reported 1996 first quarter earnings from continuing operations of $126,000 or $0.01 a share and revenues of $10.6 million.</p>
<p>The company cited slower revenue growth in Asia and North America as the primary contributors to the revenue shortfall. Fourth Shift said its management is implementing steps to resume revenue growth, reduce expenses and return the company to profitability as soon as possible. Company officials were not immediately available to provide information on the steps.</p>
<p>Fourth Shift develops open, client/server software for manufacturing and distribution companies.</p>
<p>The company also said its Fourth Shift OBJECTS Enterprise Software remains on schedule. OBJECTS is now in beta testing and a second quarter 1997 general release is planned.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to be encouraged with the enthusiastic response OBJECTS is receiving from industry analysts and prospective customers,&quot; said M.M. Stuckey, Fourth Shift's chairman and chief executive officer, in a statement.</p>
<p>Shares of Fourth Shift closed off 1/4 to 4-3/4.</p>
