<p>An Oracle Corp. software unit has agreed to buy a company controlled by Netscape Communications Corp. in a bid to beef up the network computer, a key weapon for Oracle in its battle with Microsoft Corp.</p>
<p>Oracle said Monday that its Network Computer Inc. (NCI) unit will acquire Navio Communications Inc., which is owned by Netscape and other investors. In return, Oracle, based in Redwood Shores, Calif., issued an undisclosed number of NCI shares to Netscape and the other investors.</p>
<p>Oracle will merge Navio's operations -- with its software expertise -- with NCI. The new company will operate under the NCI name. Oracle remains NCI's largest shareholder, while Netscape gets a minority stake, the companies said.</p>
<p>Financial terms were not disclosed, but Oracle said it expects to take a $60 million charge in its fiscal first quarter, ending Aug. 31, for the transaction.</p>
<p>The transaction will help NCI develop cheap devices similar to personal computers that let consumers browse the Internet, the companies said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our combined efforts will accelerate the adoption of Network Computers in the consumer, corporate and education markets and make the power of the Internet available to everyone,&quot; said Jerry Baker, NCI's chief executive.</p>
<p>Network Computers, or NCs, are similar to PCs but have less electronics. Because they get their computing power from corporate or public computer networks, such as the Internet, they are expected to be cheaper to operate than PCs.</p>
<p>For the past year, Navio and NCI separately have been developing fundamental software for NCs, NCI aiming its software at corporate customers, Navio at consumers.</p>
<p>Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison has been pushing the NC, because the underlying networks would demand Oracle software. Ellison also plans to use the NC as a weapon against Microsoft, since the NC does not need Microsoft Windows or Microsoft applications to operate.</p>
<p>Microsoft has taken the threat from NCs and similar cheap computers seriously. Last month, the world's biggest personal computer software company agreed to pay $425 million to buy WebTV Networks Inc., a designer of set-top boxes that let consumers browse the Internet through their TV sets.</p>
<p>&quot;If you're two relative pygmies and you stand on each other's shouldars, you have a better chance of swatting the giant,&quot; said Ira Machefsky, vice president at market research firm Giga Information Group in Santa Clara, Calif.</p>
<p>Navio executives said they expected to have a device geared toward consumers ready by Christmas.</p>
<p>Netscape executives also said they can now concentrate even more on writing Internet software for business customers.</p>
<p>Netscape set up Navio last year to develop Internet access software for devices other than PCs. Netscape sold Navio stakes to several other companies but remained the largest shareholder.</p>
<p>Netscape shares rose 75 cents to $30 and Oracle fell 12.5 cents to $44.25 on Nasdaq.</p>
