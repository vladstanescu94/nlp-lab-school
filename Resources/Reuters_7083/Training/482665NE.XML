<p>Shares of Project Software &amp; Development Inc and FileNet Corp were hammered in pre-opening trading on Tuesday.</p>
<p>FileNet shares slipped 5-7/8 to 10 at their last sale, traders said, after the company's fourth quarter earnings came in below Wall Street expectations.  </p>
<p>FileNet, which makes data processing systems using optical disk technology, released results after the close of trading on Tuesday with fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.20 compared to $0.32 last year.</p>
<p>The earnings were in line with a company forecast in January, when it warned of lower fourth quarter profits because of delayed orders by customers.</p>
<p>A source at PaineWebber said earlier the company was downgraded to hold from buy.  </p>
<p>Project Software &amp; Development Inc shares were also selling sharply lower in pre-opening trading.</p>
<p>&quot;They're getting crushed,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>The stock was off 20, knocking its value down to about 11-1/4.</p>
<p>The company forecast earnings per share of $0.15, compared to $0.24 in the same period last year. Its software is used to maintain high-value capital assets such as plants, facilities and production equipment.  </p>
<p>No earlier profit estimates were immediately available for FileNet or Project Software.</p>
