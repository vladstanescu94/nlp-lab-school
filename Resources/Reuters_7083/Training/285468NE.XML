<headline>Medicus to buy stock from its founder.</headline>

<p>Medicus Systems Corp, a provider of healthcare decision support systems, said Friday its board approved purchasing one million shares of common stock and 500 shares of voting preferred from its founder, Richarld Jelinek.</p>
<p>It said Jelinek will step down as chairman, but remain a director. The repurchased stock, including about 15.6 percent of the outstanding common shares and 100 percent of the authorized voting preferred, will be retired.  </p>
<p>Medicus also said it will pay Jelinek an aggregate purchase price of $4.5 million in cash, $2 million in two-year notes and 400,000 warrants to purchase common stock exercisable at $8 per share.</p>
<p>The company expects the action to have a positive impact on future earnings per share. The transaction is subject to final approval of the company's shareholders at the annual meeting in March and a fairness opinion, which will be issued by the investment banking firm of Punk, Ziegel and Knoell.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr. Jelinek has made significant contributions to Medicus since founding the company over 27 years ago, but his interests have changed over the past several years as have Medicus' forus and future direction,&quot; said president Patrick Sommers in a statement.</p>
<p>Medicus also said it named John Kunz, formerly president and chief executive of Dun &amp; Bradstreet Business Information Services, to its board of directors. Sommers noted that, since completing his tenure at D&amp;B, Kunz has been active for the past seven years as a consultant to senior management teams on acquisitions, marketing, profit and growth strategies and strategic planning.</p>
