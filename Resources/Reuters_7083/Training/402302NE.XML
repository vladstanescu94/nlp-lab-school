<p>Japanese toymaker Bandai Co Ltd said on Tuesday that it would sell a version of its &quot;virtual pet&quot; software for use on Nintendo machines, giving fans a new and more challenging way to play the game.</p>
<p>The &quot;tamagocchi&quot;, an electronic bird-like creature on a key-ring display, has been a sell-out success in Japan.</p>
<p>The aim of the game is to raise and nurture the creature, whose lifespan depends on the quality of care provided, using electronic commands.</p>
<p>Bandai said it would supply software for the hit product to run on Nintendo Co Ltd's 8-bit &quot;Game Boy&quot; machine as early as July. This will include the same games as the key-ring type and also allow users to raise a brood of virtual &quot;chicks&quot;.</p>
<p>Although Bandai is due to merge with Nintendo rival Sega later this year to create a powerful entertainment entity, it will continue to provide software to run on other game makers' machines.</p>
<p>Bandai has already introduced two types of tamagocchi characters for its key-chain game. The Game Boy software will be able to play both types and will give users the added challenge of raising three of the creatures at once, a Bandai spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The pet software is expected to retail for 4,286 yen ($35) and will be sold only in Japan, the spokeswoman said. Bandai did not give forecasts for expected sales or profits.</p>
<p>Bandai's tamagocchi has become the latest Japanese craze, selling on the street for more than 20 times its original retail price of 1,980 yen ($16). The name tamagocchi is based on the Japanese word for egg, as the original key-ring type is oval-shaped.</p>
<p>In light of its success here, Bandai announced earlier this month that it would introduce the tamagocchi in Europe, the United States and elsewhere in Asia later this year.</p>
<p>The digital pet can be fed and stroked and &quot;goes to the bathroom&quot; -- in an electronic sense -- just like a live pet. It will &quot;die&quot; if neglected.</p>
<p>Psychologists have said the game, which has been popular with high school students, satisfies nurturing and parenting instincts that can go unfulfilled in a cramped urban environment with limited scope for raising real pets.</p>
<p>Bandai, a major Japanese toy maker also known for the Power Rangers action figures, and Sega Enterprises Ltd announced last month that they would merge in October.</p>
<p>But Bandai president Makoto Yamashina told a news conference on January 23 that the company would maintain its business ties with game makers other than Sega after the merger.</p>
<p>A Sega spokesman said on Tuesday that it does not expect its merger partner's move to affect its business. &quot;We have acknowledged that Bandai plans to continue to supply its software to various game makers,&quot; he said.  ($1=122 yen)</p>
