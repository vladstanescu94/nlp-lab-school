<title>USA: Systems of Excellence chairman Huttoe sentenced.</title>

<text>
<p>A federal judge Friday sentenced Charles Huttoe, former chairman of Systems of Excellence Inc., to 46 months in prison for his role in a scheme to manipulate the price of the company's stock.</p>
<p>James Catheris, U.S. District Court judge for the Eastern District of Virigina, also fined Huttoe $10,000 and ordered that after prison his activities be monitored for two years.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission had charged that Huttoe manipulated the market for the company's stock by issuing false, favourable information through a stock promoter and then selling his shares after the price had risen.</p>
<p>Huttoe pleaded guilty on Nov., 13, 1996, to one count of securities fraud and one count of money laundering.</p>
<p>The SEC charged that from March 1995 through September 1996 Huttoe distributed about 11 million shares of unregistered company stock to family members and others.</p>
<p>It also charged that Huttoe transferred about $7.6 million in trading profits from brokerage accounts that had been opened in the names of the relatives and others.</p>
<p>The SEC in November sued Systems of Excellence, a maker of video teleconferencing equipment with offices in Virginia and Florida, and Huttoe.</p>
<p>The agency is still seeking to recover more than $12 million in illegal profits from the sale of securities by Huttoe, a Miami resident, and members of his family, it said.</p>
