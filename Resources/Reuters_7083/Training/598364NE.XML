<p>Microsoft Corp said Tuesday it demonstrated that the Microsoft BackOffice family of server applications can manage large enterprise applications, including online banking systems, large data warehouses and enterprise mail systems.</p>
<p>The Redmond, Wash.-based software company, in New York for its so-called &quot;Scalability Day,&quot; also unveiled its new enterprise editions of Windows NT Server, Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft BackOffice.  </p>
<p>&quot;As we showed today, any business of any size can now run its enterprise applications on Microsoft software and industry-standard hardware,&quot; said Bill Gates, chairman and chief executive.</p>
<p>&quot;Combining enterprise-class scalability with PC-industry volume economics will radically reshape the enterprise market,&quot; Gates said.  </p>
<p>The company said it demonstrated what its high-end Windows NT operating system can do on large-scale systems.</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, Microsoft Transaction Server 1.0 and Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 were used to process the equivalent of 1.8 billion automated teller machine transactions in a 24-hour period, the company said.</p>
<p>The next version of Microsoft SQL Server, called &quot;Sphinx,&quot; which goes into beta testing next month, was used to access a terabyte-sized database of mapping information and satellite images of Earth which could contain 10 billion sales records, one billion business letters or 50 million fax images.  </p>
<p>Microsoft Internet Information Server was used to demonstrate more than 100 million Web hits per day.</p>
<p>Microsoft's clustering technology, called &quot;Wolfpack,&quot; provided automatic system failover with SAP AG R/3 enterprise application running on a pair of Tandem Computers Inc servers.</p>
<p>Microsoft said its industry partners are delivering the tools needed to handle the large-scale applications, including vendors like Tandem, Data General Corp and Unisys Corp all of which announced eight- to 64-processor hardware running Windows NT Server.</p>
<p>Enterprise application vendors including SAP, Aurum Software Inc, The Baan Co, PeopleSoft Inc, Prologic Corp and  SAS Institute Inc also demonstrated the capacity of their products for Microsoft BackOffice, the company said.</p>
