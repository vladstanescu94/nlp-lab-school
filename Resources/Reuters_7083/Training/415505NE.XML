<headline>Summit Medical to cut costs, take charge.</headline>
<dateline>MINNEAPOLIS 1997-03-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Summit Medical Systems Inc said Monday it expects to take a charge in the first quarter for severance and other costs related to a cost-cutting program.</p>
<p>Summit said it hopes to reduce annualized expenses by 20 percent by the end of the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>The company said it expects to reduce the number of employees throughout the company, except in the BSM Consulting Group and recently acquired C. L. McIntosh &amp; Associates consulting subsidiaries, to which it intends to devote additional resources.  </p>
<p>Summit Medical provides systems and information services for the healthcare industry.</p>
<p>Earlier, Summit said that it expects to revise downward revenues reported for 1996 and, potentially, 1995 and 1994. Preliminarily, the company said it estimates revenues for 1994, 1995 and 1996 have been overstated in the aggregate by $4.0 million to $6.0 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Summit Medical is extremely concerned by the discovery of accounting errors and is working vigorously to correct past mistakes and to establish stricter management controls and policies,&quot; Kevin Green, chief executive officer, said.  </p>
<p>Summit said it expects to announce corrected financial information, and to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission audited financial statements, on or before March 31.</p>
<p>That report and filing would also include any restated financial statements for 1994 and 1995, the company said.</p>
<p>Green added that the company remains committed to pursuing its business strategy.</p>
<p>&quot;The company will focus its operations on its client/server technology along with its continuous quality service program in cardiovascular specialties, which combines the company's clinical outcomes software with integration, implementation and consulting services,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The company also will continue the development of its consulting businesses, the BSM Consulting Group and C. L. McIntosh &amp; Associates, to serve providers, medical industry manufacturers and payors.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, the company is working to establish on-line registries on behalf of medical industry manufacturing companies,&quot; Green said.</p>
<p>Summit Medical shares were off 1-1/4 at 3-1/2 on Monday.</p>
