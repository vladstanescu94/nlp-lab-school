<p>Shares in Finnish food group Raisio Tehtaat surged last week on the promise of future earnings from its cholesterol-cutting agent Benecol, but little of the profit will show until 1999, analysts say.</p>
<p>The Finnish food group's patented fat-soluble cholesterol makes it a pioneer in a new wave of so-called &quot;nutraceuticals&quot; firms, which manufacture food products designed to appeal to a mounting demand for people to eat themselves healthy.</p>
<p>Unlike some rivals, it has a ready and effective product.</p>
<p>Analysts agree the U.S. market for the product among cholesterol-cutting consumers holds huge potential for Raisio, but have mixed views on the share's upside now. They add also that it is difficult to value a first-comer to a new sector.</p>
<p>News last week Raisio will work with U.S. health care giant Johnson &amp; Johnson to sell Benecol in the United States took its stock to levels justified only by assuming very strong earnings growth in 1999 and onwards, they said.</p>
<p>Raisio now trades at price-to-earnings multiples above 50 times analysts' forecasts for this year, but at upgraded forecasts for 1999, its P/E ratio is between 20 and 30 which many analysts said is normal for a strong growth stock.</p>
<p>&quot;A top growth company could have a P/E of 20 to 30 under normal circumstances,&quot; said Postipankki analyst Pirjo Myllyniemi.</p>
<p>Raisio's stock added over 70 percent last week on the deal with J&amp;J unit McNeil, peaking at 652 markka on Thursday and after a correction on Friday, found a more steady level closer to 600 markka, trading up 2.00 at 625.00 on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;In the market's view, Raisio is a purely speculative company,&quot; said Carnegie analyst Risto Murto. &quot;This game has gone to the point where you either believe or you don't,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Raisio now trades more than 10 times higher than its 50-60 markka range before launching Benecol in Finland, but some analysts see further upside.</p>
<p>CSFB reissued a buy recommendation when the share traded at 585 markka and set a 12-month price target of 900 markka.</p>
<p>Analysts in a straw poll forecast Raisio's earnings per share rising to above 20 markka in 1999 from last year's 6.13 markka. Many forecasts for this year are also over 10 markka.</p>
<p>But they said estimating the full impact that Benecol will have on Raisio's earnings is difficult.</p>
<p>&quot;The product is new and that causes uncertainty, and the details of the deal with McNeil are still unknown,&quot; Murto said.</p>
<p>And it is not easy to find a benchmark to value Raisio, since the food industry is traditionally not fast-growing.</p>
<p>The Helsinki stock exchange market p/e is about 15 times 1997 earnings and 11 to 12 times 1998 earnings, Opstock analyst Rami Kinnala said.</p>
<p>Food giant Nestle, which targets four percent annual sales growth, trades around 17 times forecast 1998 earnings according to Edinburgh Financial Publishing (EFP) consensus forecasts.</p>
<p>European pharmaceuticals producers may give a better comparison, but very few offer the same sharp growth prospects as Raisio.</p>
<p>Glaxo-Wellcome, facing loss of revenue on its Zantac blockbuster, trades around 23 times 1998 earnings.</p>
<p>On the other hand comparing Raisio with booming tech firms like Netscape would sound ridiculous, one analyst said.</p>
