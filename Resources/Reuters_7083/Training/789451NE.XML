<p>Singapore's government is heading the fight to wipe out the computer millennium bug in the island city.</p>
<p>It has told all its departments to correct computer systems by the end of 1998, giving them a whole year to test and flush out any residual problems caused by computers which use only two numbers to show the year.</p>
<p>That means at the turn of the century, many computers will show 00 for the year and interpret it as 1900, potentially creating havoc Singapore is determined to avoid.</p>
<p>&quot;A task force was launched in November 1996 to help the civil service and government bodies to rectify their computer systems for 2000,&quot; Ong Lih Ling, an official at the National Computer Board (NCB) told Reuters.</p>
<p>Ong, deputy director at NCB's plans office, said it would continue to run public awareness seminars.</p>
<p>A parliamentary debate in July raised the issue, indicating how serious the government is at defusing the computer time bomb.</p>
<p>Last month, the government announced funds to help small and medium-sized business pay for half of the consultancy fee incurred to beat the bug.</p>
<p>UNIQUE SINGAPORE BUG</p>
<p>In Singapore, another bug may cripple businesses and services at the turn of the century.</p>
<p>This is where the government assigns a unique identification number with the prefix &quot;S&quot; for citizens and permanent residents and &quot;F&quot; for foreigners holding long-term work permits.</p>
<p>Most people &quot;S&quot; stood for Singapore and that it would always be there -- until the government told them that it was a century prefix meaning the person was born in the 1900s.</p>
<p>So no one made no provision for the prefix when setting up their computer programmes.</p>
<p>Come 2000, the century prefix for citizens and permanent residents becomes &quot;T&quot; and &quot;G&quot; for foreigners.</p>
<p>Organisations which use identification numbers for validation of transactions will have to make provisions for the prefix on their systems.</p>
<p>HOUSING BOARD GETS BALL ROLLING</p>
<p>One government department, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) started the ball rolling on the millenium bug as early as 1990.</p>
<p>The HDB, which provides subsidised housing for the majority of Singaporeans, estimates it will spend Singapore $2.8 million ($2 million) on the project, said HDB chief information officer Alex Siow.</p>
<p>Siow, also president of the Singapore Computer Society, said the HDB's early start had kept the cost down.</p>
<p>Even so, it will have to build filters to &quot;trap external bugs&quot; as not everyone it deals with would have corrected their systems by the government's deadline.</p>
<p>Among government-linked companies arming themselves is Singapore Telecommunications (SingTel).</p>
<p>It will spend at least S$20 million and use up some 21,000 man-hours to stamp out the bug, said Ng Yoke Weng, SingTel's chief information officer.</p>
<p>Since it started work in August last year, 43 percent of its systems have been fixed. SingTel aims to have its systems corrected by March 31, 1999, with nine months left to catch any leftover menace.</p>
<p>LITTLE BUSINESS AWARENESS</p>
<p>A full-house at an NCB-organised seminar in July raised concerns that there is little awareness of the millennium bug issue among businesses.</p>
<p>The seminar tried to drum home the point that businesses should not regard it as purely technical.</p>
<p>A great amount of &quot;evangelising&quot; is needed as firms not only have to correct their own systems but ensure their business partners have done so as well.</p>
<p>And the longer they procrastinate, the more costly it gets as programmers will be in short supply and consultancy and legal fees will shoot up.</p>
<p>The issue is a potential legal minefield as well.</p>
<p>Who should be liable for negligence if someone suffers a loss? In what instance is the insertion of the date error considered a crime, a rash act or negligence?</p>
<p>Toh See Kiat, managing partner at Arthur Loke &amp; Partners advised businesses to closely review their software, procurement and maintenance agreements.</p>
<p>They may have to include &quot;damage control&quot; clauses such as making software vendors &quot;repair&quot; any millennium defects and take preventive action.</p>
<p>Firms have to take steps to prevent breach of confidentiality during the conversion process and specify a time of completion for projects with damages to be paid if the deadline was not made, Toh said.</p>
<p>The seminar brought light to many firms' plight -- they don't even know where to start and how to budget.</p>
<p>The NCB said it would provide firms with checklists on what to do and advice on costing.</p>
<p>Its Year 2000 homepage at http://www.ncb.gov.sg/ncb/yr2000 gives a list of basic steps to take and a Year 2000 date change warranty which should be included in future computer vendor contracts.</p>
<p>Siow told Reuters he would initiate a survey by the end of this year to find out the state of readiness of companies and the kind of assistance they needed. ($ = 1.431 Singapore Dollars)</p>
