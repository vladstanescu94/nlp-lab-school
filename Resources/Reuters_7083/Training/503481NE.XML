<title>USA: Structural Dynamics case settled with SEC.</title>
<headline>Structural Dynamics case settled with SEC.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-04-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission said Thursday it settled charges with Structural Dynamics Research Corp and five former senior officers involving the company's inflated 1992 through September 1994 revenues and earnings reports.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the settlement, the company agreed not to repeat the alleged offenses. The former officers agreed to pay a total of about $1.5 million in monetary relief to settle the agency's civil charges, the SEC said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the culmination frankly of an investigation which commenced with the company's own understanding of disclosure to the SEC back in Sept. 1994 of what appeared to be a very serious problem,&quot; said Mark VanderLaan, a Cincinatti attorney representing Structural Dynamics.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that the results of the SEC's investigation confirm the basic findings the company made as it looked into this matter,&quot; VanderLaan added.</p>
<p>The former officers are Ronald Friedman, formerly the company's chairman and chief executive officer; Ronald Hoffman, the former chief financial officer; Robert Fischer, former senior vice-president; Tony Tolani, former vice presdient and Richard LaJoie, formerly the company's controller.</p>
<p>Tolani pled guilty Thursday to related criminal charges and faces a maximum of five years in prison, three years of supervised release, and related fines.</p>
<p>The agency separately settled administrative charges with two former partners of KPMG Peat Marwick, who were the independent auditors at the time.</p>
