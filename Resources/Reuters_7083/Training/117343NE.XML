<p>Netscape Communications Corp senior vice president of technology Marc Andreessen said the company aims to have at least 50 percent of the estimated $10 billion corporate &quot;intranet&quot; market in five years.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we can get at least 50 percent of the intranet software market in five years,&quot; Andreesen said in an interview at the Netscape Strategy Day here.</p>
<p>Netscape introduced new products aimed at the intranet market and a strategy to embrace Microsoft Corp Office applications and operating systems. Intranets are corporate networks using internet technology and standards.</p>
<p>Netscape currently dominates the market for software that browses the Internet's World Wide Web with its Navigator software, with an estimated 80 percent share.  It also is the dominant player in intranets, but Microsoft and International Business Machines Corp are nipping at its heels.</p>
<p>Netscape said that a recent survey by Hambrecht &amp; Quist of 200 companies showed Netscape with a 60 percent share of intranets, Microsoft 30 percent and IBM's Lotus 10 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Dominance is hard to measure,&quot; Andreessen said. &quot;We just have to grow the company, build the sales infrastructure and ship the products as fast as possible.&quot;  </p>
<p>Netscape, which is now 2.5 years old, is under full attack by software behemoth Microsoft, which is now giving away its Internet Explorer browser software, to gain market share.</p>
<p>Netscape's new version of Navigator, 4.0, will now become part of Netscape Communicator, which it introduced Tuesday. Netscape, which used the Internet model of giving software away for free to gain a dominance of the browser market, now charges a licensing fee after a 90-day trial period.</p>
<p>The company, which went public in August 1995, is expected to grow to about 1,700 employees by year-end, up from about 400 at the time of its IPO, Andreessen said.  </p>
<p>&quot;That's a very rapid growth rate,&quot; Andreessen said. &quot;It's sort of a sink or swim environment.&quot;</p>
<p>When asked what Netscape's focus on the corporate market means to its consumer browser business, Andreessen said that he expects both corporations and consumers to use Communicator with Navigator 4.0, which has many new features, including a component called Inbox Direct.  Inbox Direct lets users receive messages, data and files from corporate intranets or the Interent on a daily basis, at no extra cost.</p>
<p>For example, a consumer or a corporate user can receive selected newspaper stories from Netscape's media partners.</p>
