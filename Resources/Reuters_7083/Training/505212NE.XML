<p>Netscape Communications Corp. is expected this week to launch its own entry into the crowded market to enable companies to &quot;push&quot; content out over the Internet.</p>
<p>The move is the next stage of the company's showdown with software giant Microsoft Corp. to lead the market for Internet software.</p>
<p>Push technology is the term used for a broad category of software that can enable news, information and even software upgrades to be automatically delivered to people's computers over the Internet without their having to search for them.</p>
<p>With more than two dozen companies already competing in the market for push technology, mostly fledgling startups just beginning to offering their first products, analysts said this battle will be even bloodier than last year's browser wars.</p>
<p>Indeed, less than six months since the first push companies burst onto the scene, the industry has already experienced its first implosion as New York-based Ifusion filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month, and terminated all but a handful of its 140 employees.</p>
<p>Industry executives and venture capital investors now predict a period of rapid consolidation, with Microsoft and Netscape likely to set some key directions and others battling it out to follow in their slipstream.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there's going to be a huge consolidation here,&quot; said Ira Machefsky, an analyst at Giga Information Group.</p>
<p>Machefsky expects Microsoft and Netscape to offer &quot;vanilla push&quot; to suit consumers, leaving room for a handful of companies to succeed by offering more industrial strength and narrowly focused products.</p>
<p>Netscape said two senior vice presidents, Marc Andreessen and Mike Homer, will hold a news briefing on Tuesday with a variety of industry partners, but it declined to elaborate on the details of its announcement.</p>
<p>Some industry executives who said they were familiar with Netscape's plans said the company will demonstrate Constellation, a feature to work on its upcoming release of Communicator -- a software package that adds richer e-mail and collaboration features to a more advanced browser.</p>
<p>The products are geared to take on the next generation of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, including many of the filtering and customizing features Microsoft began showing off in an early preview release of the product last week.</p>
<p>A month ago, Microsoft introduced a specification for creating Internet push channels that it said will be included on Internet Explorer 4.0 and for which it said more than 30 companies had already expressed support.</p>
<p>Netscape's Andreessen said at the time that the Microsoft effort was not necessary, and that similar results could be obtained using standard Internet technology, like Java.</p>
<p>&quot;We think it will essentially wither on the vine,&quot; he said of the Microsoft specification at the time, and one industry executive said Netscape still looks like it is out to &quot;thwart&quot; the Microsoft initiative.</p>
<p>Netscape is expected also to disclose key media and software partners who will support Constellation.</p>
<p>But the market for &quot;push&quot; technologies has become so overcrowded that even some of its earliest proponents, such as Marimba, which has partnered with Netscape and others to deliver software upgrades over the Web, have already begun to distance themselves from the term.</p>
<p>&quot;The word 'push' has become almost meaningless because it means almost everything and nothing (at the same time),&quot; said Kim Polese, co-founder and top executive at Marimba.</p>
<p>Jay Tannenbaum, who heads the Commercenet electronic commerce association, said he expects &quot;push&quot; will soon be eclipsed by Web technology that empowers vendors to be more selective in reaching out to buyers, rather than having information broadcast out to their screens.</p>
