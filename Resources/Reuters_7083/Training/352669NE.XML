<p>Japanese-language Internet service provider Yahoo! Japan Corp said on Monday it plans to list its shares on Japan's over-the-counter (OTC) market, buoyed by a surge in Japanese &quot;Net surfers&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We are preparing to register our shares on the over-the-counter market,&quot; a company official said, but declined to specify a date. &quot;We hope to register as early as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Media reports on Monday said the firm plans to list its shares this summer.</p>
<p>The company said it had originally intended to register its shares on the second section of the OTC, a smaller market which was set up to help start-up companies raise funds.</p>
<p>But as business has boomed, Yahoo! Japan will now seek registration on the main OTC market, the official said.</p>
<p>According to Japan's Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, the number of Internet users in Japan was estimated at five million as of July 1996, up nearly sevenfold from 720,000 in July 1994.</p>
<p>Japan's demand for international telecommunications has also grown considerably due to the Internet boom.</p>
<p>The capacity of telecommunication cables between Japan and the United States for Internet users is estimated to have risen to 468 megabits per second as of this month, up from only 10 megabits at the end of 1995, international call carrier Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd said on Monday.</p>
<p>Capacity for regular international phone calls, on the other hand, was estimated at 366 megabits per second.</p>
<p>Yahoo! Japan is a joint venture between Yahoo! Inc, a U.S.-based internet service provider, and Japanese software publisher Softbank Corp.</p>
<p>It started offering its service in Japan last April.</p>
<p>Last month, Yahoo! Inc said total page views for Yahoo! Japan amounted to about a million page views per day in September and 1.4 million in December.</p>
<p>The company, based in Santa Clara, California, defied Wall Street expectations of a fourth-quarter loss and posted a modest profit. It also had a positive cash flow for the quarter for the first time.</p>
<p>Softbank's shares were traded higher on the Yahoo! news, and were quoted in late Tokyo at 9,920 yen ($81) per share, up from 9,400 yen ($77) at last week's close.</p>
