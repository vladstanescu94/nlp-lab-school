<p>Microsoft Corp's vice president of sales and support Steve Ballmer said Latin America was seeing a strong surge in the personal computer market and forcecast software sales for the company amounting to $300 million in the region this year.</p>
<p>Ballmer, in Colombia to launch the Spanish version of Microsoft Office 97, told a news conference Microsoft's global revenues would increase between 25 and 30 percent in 1997 and said sales in Latin America would exceed that growth target.  </p>
<p>&quot;Latin American countries are underinvested in personal computers if we look at the size of the economies and the number of white-collar workers. PC use is lower than in the United States, Europe and Japan and even lower than in Eastern Europe,&quot; Baller said, commenting on the market's enormous growth potential.</p>
<p>&quot;But there's an incredible surge in acceptance of investment in PCs in Latin America. I'm very excited about the growth in the market,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>He said at least 4,000 Colombians made a direct living from Microsoft software in terms of support sales and distribution.</p>
<p>But he noted that 80 percent of software in Latin America was pirated and warned that this was threatening the development of software companies throughout the region.</p>
<p>The release of the Spanish-language version of Office 97 came just three weeks after the English version hit the market and Ballmer pledged that the differences in language release times would become ever shorter in the future.</p>
<p>He said Micosoft would spend $2 billion on research and development this year alone, adding that the combined R&amp;D costs of four other major competitors including IBM would be less than 60 percent of that figure.</p>
<p>Almost all the R&amp;D work would be carried out within two miles of Microsoft head Bill Gates's office in Redmond, Washington, he said.</p>
<p>Among new products, Ballmer said the Internet Explorer 4 package would be released worldwide in June.</p>
