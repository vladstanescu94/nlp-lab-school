<headline>Microsoft stock falls as company meets with analysts.</headline>
<dateline>SEATTLE</dateline>
<text>
<p>Microsoft Corp. stock has been on a rollercoaster ride since the software giant reported an 88 percent jump in earnings a week ago, and it fell again Thursday as executives prepared to meet with financial analysts.</p>
<p>After hitting $149.50 on July 17 -- the day Microsoft reported earnings of $1.05 billion, in line with expectations on Wall Street -- the stock has lost ground. It fell another $2 to $139.44 in active trading on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>The stock has fallen because Microsoft did not produce a &quot;blowout&quot; quarter, when it far surpasses analysts' earnings forecasts, as it did in the prior quarter. And as they have done before, officials warned after the report that earnings growth will slow.</p>
<p>But this time, Microsoft officials also said they thought the stock price might be ahead of itself. Microsoft treasurer Greg Maffei said in a conference call on July 17 that the company did not buy back any stock in the latest quarter because &quot;we thought the price was a little high.&quot;</p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown said in the same call that analysts should &quot;resist any temptation&quot; to raise their earnings estimates for the fiscal year that began July 1.</p>
<p>Brown cited expected slower growth in sales of personal computers, for which Microsoft makes its Windows 95 software, but he was bullish for the long term. Windows software is installed on 80 percent or more of the world's PCs.</p>
<p>In the past, investors have turned a deaf ear to such warnings as Microsoft consistently outperformed expectations. That had heled drive the company's stock up 150 percent in its last fiscal year and about 15 percent ahead of its most recent earnings report.</p>
<p>But now analysts said there was good reason to expect slower growth, including a schedule of new products devoid of anything likely to match the blockbuster performance of best-sellers such as Window 95 or Office 97.</p>
<p>Microsoft last week released the first major test version of its updated system known as Windows 98, and Microsoft executives are expected to discuss the product at Thursday's meeting. But from what they have seen so far, many analysts say the new system will offer users few reasons to upgrade from Windows 95.</p>
<p>The company said Thursday that it expects to boost research and development spending to $2.6 billion in fiscal 1998 from $2.2 billion in the year recently ended.</p>
<p>Maffei said in notes prepared for presentation to analysts that the company's deferred revenues are expected to rise to more than $2 billion at the end of fiscal 1998 from $1.4 billion as of June 30, 1997.</p>
