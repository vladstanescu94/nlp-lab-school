<p>Microsoft Corp's planned purchase of about 12 percent of Comcast Corp for $1 billion is expected to close in &quot;weeks, not longer,&quot; an executive of the software giant said Monday.</p>
<p>Greg Maffei, vice president for corporate development, said no federal antitrust approval is required because Microsoft is not buying voting shares of the cable television company.  </p>
<p>Comcast President Brian Roberts said in the joint telephone interview that the investment by Microsoft would accelerate the company's deployment of digital television and cable computer modems.</p>
<p>He also said the company would use the cash to pay off debt and buy back stock, although he was not specific.</p>
<p>&quot;We weren't out looking to raise capital,&quot; he said. &quot;It's more of an opportunistic situation.  We're not going to change our strategy.&quot;  </p>
<p>The investment gives Microsoft the right to a seat on Comcast's board, but for now the software giant will post only an &quot;observer,&quot; Maffei said.</p>
<p>Microsoft and its chairman Bill Gates also will offer &quot;guidance&quot; to Comcast in its deployment of new technologies such as cable modems from At Home Corp  ATHM.O, in which Comcast holds a stake, Maffei said.</p>
<p>&quot;Bill Gates is going to be working with Brian to make sure that what they're doing technologically and strategically makes sense for the long haul,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>In a separate interview, Microsoft senior vice president Craig Mundie said the investment was a &quot;natural outgrowth&quot; of discussions between Gates and Roberts over the past two months.</p>
<p>He said Comcast is a significant Microsoft customer as a user of the Windows NT operating system and Internet server software. And almost all of Comcast's cable television systems carry MSNBC, the all-news channel jointly owned by Microsoft and General Electric Co's NBC network, he said.</p>
<p>Mundie said he expects the future of television to evolve around three different products, beginning with traditional television sets with improved pictures and sound.</p>
<p>Next will be &quot;hybrid television programming,&quot; with standard television programming &quot;wrapped&quot; by related data from the Internet.</p>
<p>Finally Mundie sees an advanced form of the service offered by Web TV, which Microsoft is in the process of buying, that offers Internet access using a television set-top box.</p>
