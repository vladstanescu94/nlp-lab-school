<p>Bill Gates, computer guru and chief executive of U.S. software giant Microsoft, said on Thursday the Internet was poised to open up Africa to the world.</p>
<p>The continent's image as technologically backward was unfounded, and the Internet was enormously important for economic development, Gates told a news conference at the start of a business visit to South Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;The Internet is the single most important tool that will open Africa up to the rest of the world. It is the future of communication worldwide and Africa is not as far behind as some people believe,&quot; Gates said.</p>
<p>The Internet is a vast web of interlinked computers allowing users to &quot;surf&quot; for information and shop electronically.</p>
<p>Microsoft is expanding in Africa using South Africa as a base. Last month the software giant opened offices in Kenya and Ivory Coast and it plans to open 10 more in the next three years.</p>
<p>&quot;Africa is changing rapidly and for the better...the infrastructures are being improved to sustain these developments and Microsoft is in a position to drive this forward from South Africa,&quot; said Rob Katz, Microsoft South Africa general manager.</p>
<p>However, Africa does lag behind the developed world in its use of computers and the Internet. In the United States there are 300 personal computers for every 1,000 people. In South Africa - by far Africa's most on-line country - the figure is just 34 per 1,000.</p>
<p>Undaunted by this, Gates said the use of computers and the Internet would trickle down inevitably throughout Africa's emerging markets as first government departments and then larger businesses started to use the technology.</p>
<p>&quot;Technology is not a choice...the individual level will take a long, long time, but because we are patient and take a long- term view we were willing to come in now and build up that infrastructure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Software piracy was a problem in emerging markets and in some African countries up to 95 percent of programmes were being used in pirate form, compared to a U.S. figure of 35 percent. But as African markets developed the figures would drop, Katz said.</p>
<p>Microsoft re-entered South Africa in 1992 when the country's piracy level stood at 85 percent. Now it is about 50 percent.</p>
<p>Microsoft is gearing up for a battle with new rival network computers (NCs), which will operate corporate networks and access to the Internet without needing Microsoft's Windows operating system.</p>
<p>Gates has said the array of companies supporting NCs is the toughest challenge Microsoft has faced in years, but on Thursday he was philosophical about the threat, saying he doubted NCs would deliver on promises of low cost and ease of use.</p>
<p>&quot;The promises they have made are unachievable,&quot; he said.</p>
