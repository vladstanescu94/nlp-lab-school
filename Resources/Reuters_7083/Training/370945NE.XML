<p>Australian Provincial Newspapers Holdings Ltd said on Tuesday it plans to launch a ZDNet internet service in Australia with Japan's Softbank.  </p>
<p>Australian Provincial Newspapers (APN) also said it would be launching two Web games sites, GameSpot for personal computer games, and VideoGameSpot, for the new wave of 64-bit video game machines. Chief executive Cameron O'Reilly said at the launch of the services that these games sites were under an agreement with SpotMedia Communications, an arm of Softbank.</p>
<p>O'Reilly said the ZDNet service provides news, informational services about the Internet and computing, and is operated by Softbank's Ziff-Davis International. APN publishes the Australian editions of Ziff-Davis computer magazine titles.  </p>
<p>O'Reilly said APN will provide most of the content for the Australian ZDNet service, which would mainly come from the Ziff-Davis computer titles APN publishes including Windows Sources Australia, FamilyPC Australia and Computer Week.</p>
<p>APN will operate ZDNet through its APN Computing unit.</p>
<p>APN Computing managing director Alan Power said at the launch he expected APN's advertising revenues could increase from the new services.</p>
<p>&quot;ZDNet, GameSpot and VideoGameSpot Web sites provide dramatically increased opportunties for Web advertising and broaden significantly our client base,&quot; Power said.  </p>
<p>APN is 49 percent owned by Irish businessman Tony O'Reilly's media group Independent Newspapers Plc.</p>
<p>Cameron O'Reilly said APN was the first part of the Independent Newspapers group to launch online services, but that the rest of the group may follow. He said APN would also launch ZDNet in New Zealand later this year. &quot;They are looking at opportunities on the Net,&quot; O'Reilly told reporters.</p>
<p>He said Independent Newspaper had not had any discussions with SouthBank about launching ZDNet in other markets in which the Irish-based media group operates.</p>
