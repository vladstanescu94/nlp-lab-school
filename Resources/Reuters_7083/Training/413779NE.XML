<headline>Summit Medical to restate revenues downward.</headline>

<p>Summit Medical Systems Inc., said Monday its 1996 revenues will be &quot;substantially less&quot; than what it reported last week due to accounting discrepancies discovered by its new chief financial officer, who resigned after less than a week on the job.</p>
<p>The company, which makes computer-based information systems for the healthcare industry, said it expected to revise downward the $19.5 million in revenues it reported in 1996, and could also cut revenues for 1995 and 1994 as well.</p>
<p>Company officials were not available to comment.</p>
<p>Summit's shares fell by $1.44, or 30 percent, to $3.31 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq market.</p>
<p>Volpe, Welty &amp; Co. analyst Chris Paul said Summit was believed to have about $40 million in cash and roughly 10.5 million shares.</p>
<p>&quot;So it's trading below its cash value,&quot; he said. Still, he added, the cash the company is believed to have was &quot;providing a base for the shares.&quot;</p>
<p>Minneapolis-based Summit said a preliminary review of its books indicated that revenues for the past three years had been overstated by between $4 million and $6 million -- or between 8 percent and 12 percent of the total.</p>
<p>Summit said the concerns over its revenues stem from the erroneous recognition of some revenues from the sales of software and related services.</p>
<p>Paul said the company did not provide any further explanation to analysts on a conference call.</p>
<p>&quot;Summit Medical is extremely concerned by the discovery of accounting errors and is working vigorously to correct past mistakes and to establish stricter management controls and policies,&quot; Chief Executive Kevin Green said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company also announced that it planned to eliminate an unspecified number of jobs and establish a cost reduction program to reduce annual expenses by 20 percent.</p>
<p>That program is expected to result in an unspecified charge in the current quarter for employee severance and other costs, it said.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, Summit reported 1996 revenues of $19.5 million, up from $17.7 million in 1995. It also posted a net loss for the year of $10.4 million, compared with a year-ago loss of $7.2 million.</p>
<p>The exact size of the adjustments to revenue and the years in which they apply will not be determined until an extensive audit is completed, the company said Monday.</p>
<p>Summit said that Donald Haas, who joined the company as chief financial officer last Monday, resigned Saturday -- after informing management that some 1996 revenue had been incorrectly recognized.</p>
<p>The company said that Haas told management on Thursday, the day after the company reported its 1996 results, that it had incorrectly recognized revenue during 1996 in some circumstances.</p>
<p>Management immediately began a review of these issues, it added.</p>
<p>&quot;The company's auditors, Ernst &amp; Young LLP, have expanded the scope of their audit and are performing additional audit procedures based in part on the questions raised by Mr. Haas,&quot; Summit said in its statement.</p>
<p>Summit added that it had retained the law firm Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP to investigate the matter with the assistance of independent accounting advice from Arthur Andersen LLP.</p>
<p>The company said it expected to announce corrected financial information by the end of March.</p>
<p>The likely downward revision of revenues for at least a year comes at a time when Summit is in the midst of a product transition, said Paul.</p>
<p>The transition, Paul explained, is to a single platform for Summit's computerized information system, which collects and analyzes patient data and likely outcomes. This anlaysis enables health care providers to monitor and potentially change a patient's treatment.</p>
