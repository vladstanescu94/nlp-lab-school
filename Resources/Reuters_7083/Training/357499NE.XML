<p>Deutsche Telekom AG , broadening its relationship with Internet software maker Netscape Communications Corp., plans to expand access to the Net and develop new services for businesses, officials with the German telecommunications company said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Expanding an existing agreement to distribute Netscape's popular Web browser, Deutsche Telekom said it would adopt the entire range of Netscape products to develop the corporate networks based on Internet technology known as intranets.</p>
<p>&quot;Through the cooperation with Netscape we are expanding the spectrum of our offering in the area of the Internet and intranets and ensure that all our business customers receive solutions tailored to their needs,&quot; said Herbert May, Deutsche Telekom board member in charge of enterprise customers.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom has distributed over 10 million copies of Netscape's popular Navigator browser in succeeding versions to the 1.4 million subscribers of its online service T-Online, the largest in Germany.</p>
<p>Under the new agreement, Telekom will offer the entire range of Netscape software products, both for those viewing content on the Internet or a company's intranet, and Internet publishing software for servers.</p>
<p>T-Online subscribers will now be given the new 4.0 version of Netscape's browser, dubbed Communicator because it adds applications to enhance communicating over computer networks. Telekom will also use Netscape SuiteSpot server and local area network products. Servers are the computers that run computer networks.</p>
<p>Netscape has similar agreements, though it says not as far-reaching, with around 19 European telecommunications companies. It generates around 22 percent of its worldwide sales in Europe.</p>
<p>Netscape founder and Chairman Jim Clark said the company commands around 70 percent of the browser market and 30 percent of the Internet server market.</p>
<p>After the Internet explosion of the past two years, the next phase of development of the global network will be enhanced communication over computer networks between companies and their customers and suppliers.</p>
<p>&quot;Netscape's strategy is to develop the networked enterprise as a primary force in 1997,&quot; Clark said. &quot;We think companies like Deutsche Telekom are the best-placed to offer these services because they own the networks.&quot;</p>
<p>While German businesses have been slow to adopt Internet technology and use e-mail, Deutsche Telekom -- which recently went public -- has begun aggressively pursuing an Internet strategy and is targeting over 1,000 companies that use its T-Online for their internal communications to transform these into intranets.</p>
<p>&quot;Telekom is the biggest and most aggressive telco (telecommunications company) offering Internet services and has grasped this more quickly than many telecoms companies in the world,&quot; said Clark.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom's relationship with Netscape, while not intended to involve any capital investment, could deepen further in the coming months.</p>
<p>Netscape is not only providing software. It will also assist Telekom to develop Internet applications for businesses, and T-Online is developing a new version of its software that will be tightly integrated with Netscape software.</p>
<p>&quot;Could we just use the Netscape browser? It is not decided yet just how the new software version will look,&quot; said T-Online Managing Director Wolfgang Keuntje.</p>
<p>Keuntje said the company would install a second high-speed Internet connection to the United States in the next few months and said the service aimed to have 2 million subscribers by the end of the year.</p>
