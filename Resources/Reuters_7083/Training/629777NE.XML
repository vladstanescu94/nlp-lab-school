<title>USA: Shareholders file suit against Avant.</title>
<headline>Shareholders file suit against Avant.</headline>
<dateline>PHILADELPHIA 1997-06-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shareholders of Avant! common stock filed a complaint charging the company made fraudulent statements about its use of proprietary software technology, plaintiffs' lawyers said on Monday.</p>
<p>The complaint charges that the company and some of its senior officers failed to disclose adverse information about what it termed &quot;wrongful use&quot; of proprietary software technology from Avant!'s competitor, Cadence Design Systems Inc.</p>
<p>In a statement, lawyers for the stockholders said they sought to recover damages, but did not specify a dollar amount.  </p>
<p>The shareholders, who bought common stock in Avant! during the period from March 29, 1996, through April 11, 1997, are represented by Berger &amp; Montague P.C. and Gold Bennett &amp; Cera LLP, the statement said.</p>
<p>According to the lawyers, claims of wrongdoing made by Cadence were met with assurances by Avant! to its shareholders that the case had no merit and would not have a material adverse impact on Avant!'s financial position.</p>
<p>Then, on April 11, the Santa Clara County district attorney's office filed a criminal felony action against Avant! and members of its management charging them with theft of trade secrets and conspiracy, the statement said.</p>
<p>No one was immediately available at Avant! to comment on the case.</p>
