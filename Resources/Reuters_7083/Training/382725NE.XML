<p>Formula Systems Ltd has reached an accord with Merrill Lynch for the latter to buy warrants in the former company in a deal that could lead to a public offering in the second half, Formula Systems managing director Gadi Goldstein said on Monday.</p>
<p>Under the accord, Merrill Lynch will acquire 740,000 series 2 warrants from Formula Systems, a software company, for about $9.25 million. The 740,000 warrants, which come due shortly, entitle the holder to 10 percent of Formula Systems equity.</p>
<p>Goldstein said Formula Systems and Merrill Lynch would then work together to get an American depositary receipt (ADR) listing for Formula in the United States. Merrill Lynch would act as depositary.</p>
<p>&quot;Our and their intention is that there will be in ADR, but there is no mandatory connection (with buying the warrants),&quot; Goldstein told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said he expected Merrill Lynch to acquire the warrants in the next several days and convert them to stock within a week after that.</p>
<p>The agreement allows Merrill Lynch to sell back the warrants with 18 months, but Goldstein said that since the warrants were deep in the money, it was highly unlikely Merrill Lynch would exercise it.</p>
<p>Formula Systems acquired the warrants over the past year on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange for an average price of less than five shekels each. It will be selling them for about 17 shekels to Merrill Lynch, but Formula Systems bought its own securities it would not report a capital gain on the transaction, Goldstein said.</p>
<p>Goldstein said the agreement was aimed at paving the way for a probable U.S. offering later this year by raising Formula Systems' market valuation. Formula Systems is traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, where it closed at 49.62 shekels on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are thinking about having a real issue of about $40 million,&quot; Goldstein said. &quot;But we are dissatisfied with the price of the company in Israel. We feel the Americans will give us a better rating.&quot;</p>
<p>Goldstein says the ADRs should boost Formnula Systems' Tel Aviv share price by arbitrage trading.</p>
<p>&quot;The price will be made by the Americans. We've seen that with every other (Israeli arbitrage) stock,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The ADRs will not be Formula Systems' first taste of the American market. The company has three Nasdaq-traded subsidiaries, two of which, Crystal Software Solutions and Wiztec Solutions, were floated in the last 10 months.</p>
<p>Goldstein said Formula Systems may, alternatively or additionally, float in the United States two closely held subsidairies -- Transtech Controls Ltd, which makes aircraft ground navigation systems, and Formula Software Services.</p>
<p>Goldstein said he saw the U.S. offerings as part of Formula Systems' strategy of becoming an international company. He said he expected the company to show overseas sales of $50 million to $60 million this year on total revenues of $150 million.</p>
