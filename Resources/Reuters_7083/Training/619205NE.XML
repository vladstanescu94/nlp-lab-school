<headline>Networking stocks continue rally on strong outlook.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-28</dateline>

<p>Networking stocks continued to rally Wednesday amid an brightening outlook on sales and earnings, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The latest information on sales is that they are pretty good.  The optimism for the rest of the year is pretty strong,&quot; said James Wade, an analyst with Alex. Brown.</p>
<p>3Com Corp jumped 3-1/8 to 49-7/8, adding to steady gains made since sinking to 26-3/4 at the end of April. U.S. Robotics Corp surged 5-1/2 to 86-1/4. Cabletron Systems Inc added three to 46 and FORE Systems Inc firmed 1-1/16 to 15-13/16.  </p>
<p>Analysts said 3Com and U.S. Robotics, which are expected to complete their merger next month, got an added boost Wednesday on positive comments made by Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Robertson, Stephens analyst Paul Johnson raised his rating on 3Com to buy from market performer, citing increasing investor expectations and indications of improving business trends.  </p>
<p>Robertson, Stephens said business in the networking sector appears to be getting better, with recent trends at 3Com confirming its views that the second half of 1997 would be stronger than the first half.</p>
<p>SoundView Financial Group Inc also raised Bay Networks Inc to short-term buy from hold.  The long-term rating remained unchanged at hold.  </p>
<p>Although there is lingering concern about pricing for networking products, near-term earnings expectations will continue to provide a boost to the sector, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a quarter by quarter thing. So far, 3Com and Cabletron are looking like they will be OK, and they are the first to report (earnings),&quot; said Paul Weinstein, an analyst at PaineWebber.</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter ending May 31, analysts expect 3Com to earn $0.48 a share, compared with $0.46 a share last year, according to First Call.  Cabletron is expected to earn $0.49 a share in its May quarter, up from $0.39 a share last year.</p>
<p>Although investors have become more optimistic about networking stocks in general, Weinstein cautioned that each stock &quot;is moving for different reasons.&quot;</p>
<p>Weinstein had reiterated a buy rating on 3Com on Tuesday.</p>
<p>3Com, for example, has gained strength on views that it can withstand competition from Intel Corp in the adapter card segment, analysts said.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange networking index rallied 9.77 point or 3.27 percent to 308.70, compared with a slight drop in the Nasdaq composite index. Nasdaq lost 1.20 points or 0.09 percent to 1408.01.</p>
