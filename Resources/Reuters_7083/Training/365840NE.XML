<p>Silicon Graphics Inc (SGI) and a number of current leaders in hardware and software for computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) will Monday announce an effort to define an open, next-generation graphics interface, executives said.</p>
<p>Silicon Graphics, which has already widely licensed its OpenGL three-dimensional graphics interface to key industry players, has played a leading role drawing together the companies, which held their first meeting last month.  </p>
<p>Companies that have expressed interest in the committee include Dassault Systems, Division, Hewlett-Packard Co, International Business Machines Corp, Structural Dynamics Research Corp.</p>
<p>Silicon Graphics has been a leader in the high-end graphical workstation market, but is viewed as increasingly under pressure from higher-end personal computer systems running on Microsoft software and Intel processors.  </p>
<p>Some executives said the effort by a number of industry players was aimed at preventing Microsoft, whose Windows NT software is challenging more established systems at increasingly high-end, graphics-intensive tasks, from taking over the role of standard-setter with its own technology.</p>
<p>Microsoft had attended initial meetings, however, one executive said, and could become a participant.</p>
<p>The new technology promises to offer advances in both quality and productivity in the intensive number-crunching tasks which major manufacturers like automakers and aerospace companies need to design complex new products.  </p>
<p>Silicon Graphics said it would be willing to turn over to the group next-generation technology it has yet to unveil. The new technology is expected to be used on a wide range of platforms ranging from Windows 95 and NT to Unix.</p>
<p>The new standard software framework, known as application programming interface, will be designed to render graphics with greater performance, speed and interactivity and will be based on Silicon Graphics' OpenGL graphics library.</p>
<p>Janet Matsuda, manager for emerging markets and technologies at Mountain View-based Silicon Graphics, said by extending OpenGL, the standard can provide greater performance with less customer work by the companies using the systems.</p>
<p>The group's next meeting is set for March.</p>
