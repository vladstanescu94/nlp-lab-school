<p>Allegations over insider dealings at German software group SAP refused to die down on Friday as German securities watchdog BAWe insisted several cases of insider dealing by SAP staff could be proved.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters late on Thursday, BAWe vice president Georg Dreyling said he was certain between five and 10 cases of insider dealing in SAP shares were proveable and that the watchdog planned to make further inquiries.</p>
<p>&quot;Objectively, between five and 10 primary SAP insiders certainly engaged in insider trading,&quot; Dreyling said.</p>
<p>SAP declined to comment on his remarks. An SAP spokesman told Reuters on Friday: &quot;We can't say anything about that.&quot;</p>
<p>Frankfurt prosecutors have launched an investigation to establish whether insider information was used to trade SAP shares and derivatives around the time of the firm's third quarter results announcement on October 22 last year.</p>
<p>After the October results announcement, which came in well below market expectations, SAP shares plunged 23 percent.</p>
<p>The BAWe investigated the sharp price fall and said they had found enough evidence of dubious activity to pass the case on to prosecutors.</p>
<p>The BAWe's Dreyling told reporters on Thursday that the SAP case was the biggest in Germany since insider dealing was criminalised in 1994.</p>
<p>But prosecutors said on Thursday that the probe had produced no evidence of wrongdoing among 71 SAP staff who had direct access to the results information ahead of time.</p>
<p>The 71 were staff members who SAP said knew by October 18 last year that third quarter results would fall below market expectations.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the investigation would now be focused on four SAP employees who had more limited access to information. None of these was a member of SAP's management or supervisory staff.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, SAP said that suspicion of illegal trading by so-called primary insiders had been &quot;largely refuted&quot;.</p>
<p>The firm has said that it will in future take extra precautions curbing the trading of SAP share by its staff.</p>
<p>SAP's chief executive Dietmar Hopp told a magazine recently that employess would be prevented from trading SAP stock in the sensitive three weeks at the end of each quarter.</p>
<p>He said anyone who broke the rule, which also covered top-level employees, could be fired.</p>
