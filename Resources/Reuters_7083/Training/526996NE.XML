<title>USA: U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Lagging technology stocks.</title>
<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Lagging technology stocks.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>A lack of interest in many technology stocks, which have been badly lagging the resurgent broader market, kept implied volatilities for their options subdued, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to be a sellers' market,&quot; said Michael Schwartz, a managing director of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. &quot;They're not bidding them (technology sector options) up.&quot;</p>
<p>Weaker stocks usually lead to higher implied volatilities, but Schwartz noted that investors appeared to be expecting the tech stocks to be mired in choppy but range-bound trading that would let time decay eat away option premiums.  </p>
<p>Implied volatilities for technology stock options tend to swing wildly, particularly on a down move in the stocks due to bids for protective puts and subsequent bottom-picking attempts by call speculators.</p>
<p>But traders said few such tendencies were seen today in the sector, which was split between the big names like Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp, which shared the overall market's bullishness, and the battered shares, namely networking stocks like 3Com Corp and Cisco Systems Inc, still reeling from Monday's news that Intel was entering their business.  </p>
<p>Schwartz said implied volatilities for at-the-money options in Microsoft and Intel as well as 3Com U.S. Robotics Corp were all generally in line with their actual historical volatilities.</p>
<p>In an illustration of interest to sell rather than buy options in these tech stocks, Hank Nothnagel, a senior vice president of options trading at EVEREN Securities, said he saw a lot of selling in U.S. Robotics May 45.0 calls.</p>
<p>He said the selling was largely outright, although part of it was against stock positions. The stock bounced to a high of 47 by late trade from lows near 40 and Monday's 45-1/16 close.  </p>
<p>Still, Schwartz added that volume in International Business Machines Corp options centered on the upside strikes, indicating speculative interest in the stock ahead of the firm's quarterly earnings due out on Wednesday.</p>
<p>IBM May 140 calls had volume of nearly 7,000 contracts shortly before the close, while the 145 and 150 strikes also had more than 3,700 contracts each. Implied volatilities were slightly higher than Monday's, in the upper 30-percent range.</p>
<p>Schwartz said a string of positive earnings surprises in recent days was fueling optimism.  </p>
<p>Elsewhere, Conseco Inc May 30 calls topped the most-actives list on the American Stock Exchange, with turnover of 3,500 contracts.</p>
<p>Harrison Roth, first vice president of Cowen &amp; Co, said the volume -- selling in two batches of 1,750 contracts each -- was probably due to profit-taking. He noted that open interest in the deep in-the-money contract had totalled 3,580 contracts as of end-Monday.</p>
<p>The stock, after peaking in mid-February at 43-7/8 and sliding to lows near 34 in March and early April, was up 7/8 on the day at 38-3/8 in late trade.</p>
