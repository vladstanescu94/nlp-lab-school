<p>The controversial sale of 3.54 million shares in German software maker SAP AG was pronounced a success on Thursday by consortium leader UBS, which said demand for the stock had twice outstripped supply.</p>
<p>UBS (Union Bank of Switzerland) said the shares were placed at 244 marks -- just below where SAP's shares traded Thursday -- and that European and U.S. investors had taken a keen interest in the bookbuilding phase.</p>
<p>&quot;We were pleasantly suprised by the success of the placement,&quot; said a UBS executive, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>&quot;We could say this was a truly global placement.&quot;</p>
<p>The shares on offer, which represent 5.7 percent of SAP's 61 million common shares, were part of an 11.2 percent stake sold off to a trust fund last year by SAP co-founder Hans-Werner Hector despite harsh criticism from colleagues.</p>
<p>Under mild pressure from the sale, SAP's common stock eased 4.30 marks to 244.70 marks in bourse trade on Thursday, but dealers said the placement buoyed the stock over 244 marks.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't be surprised to see some follow-up interest in the next few days,&quot; said one Frankfurt dealer.</p>
<p>SAP's more liquid preferred shares, of which there are 42 million and which were listed on the blue chip DAX index in 1995, fell 4.70 marks to 249.80.</p>
<p>SAP, one of the world's top five software groups and onetime darling of the German stock market, has had an unusually rocky few months.</p>
<p>Its stock price plunged dramatically last year after a shock profit warning for 1996, but started to recover in recent weeks after actual results turned out better than expected.</p>
<p>The company last week reported a 40 percent rise in 1996 net profit to 67 million marks and a 38 percent improvement in sales to 3.72 billion -- easing market concerns that it would not sustain its early strong growth rates.</p>
<p>Hector, the former owner of the shares sold, resigned his position on the company's supervisory board last December after a long-running leadership dispute with SAP chairman Dietmar Hopp. The dispute hieghtened when Hector passed on his stake in SAP to the Eugenia Trust.</p>
<p>Hector's move was viewed by SAP as threatening the grip of the four remaining founders on the company. The transfer brings the founders' joint ownership below a 74 percent floor specified in a agreement that pools their voting rights.</p>
