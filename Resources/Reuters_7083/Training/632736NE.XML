<title>USA: Technology stock warnings spook Wall Street.</title>
<headline>Technology stock warnings spook Wall Street.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Technology stocks slipped Tuesday after several companies warned of lower-than-expected earnings, spooking Wall Street into a retreat from the sector.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is pretty much the nervous nellies on Wall Street,&quot; said Farrokh Billimoria, an analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist. &quot;You've got Intel, you've got another one coming out right on its heels. It is kind of 'what's next?'&quot;</p>
<p>The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite fell about 20 to 1385, led in volume by Intel Corp which warned last Friday that it expected its second-quarter earnings to fall below estimates.  </p>
<p>The Intel warning was followed by similar flags raised Monday by Seagate Technology Inc and Cabletron Systems Inc, both of which said quarterly results would come in below expectations.</p>
<p>Ashok Kumar, an analyst at Southcoast Capital Corp, said the market reaction reflected a temproary retreat from the sector.</p>
<p>&quot;It just was a confluence of all the factors. To begin with, it is a traditionally weak season and (tech stocks) have had a good run of it. The safest thing to do is to step back and wait for the dust to settle,&quot; Kumar said.  </p>
<p>Intel shares were off 4-3/4 to 145 on Nasdaq. Leading the volume on the New York Stock Exchange was Cabletron which fell 15-5/8 to 30-1/8, followed by Seagate, down 3-3/4 to 38-5/8.</p>
<p>Cabletron, a supplier of network equipment, said late Monday its first-quarter net income would be about $0.37 per share compared to analysts' estimates of $0.50 per share largely due to a decline in international sales.</p>
<p>&quot;We do have concerns regarding our investment thesis near-term for the shares of Cabletron. We believe the shares will continue to be under pressure..until the fall,&quot; Salomon Brothers analyst Peter Swartz said in a research report.  </p>
<p>Swartz and several other analysts proceeded to cut their ratings and earnings estimates while the stock tumbled lower Tuesday. It also weighed down related stocks, such as Bay Networks Inc, Cisco Systems Inc and 3Com Corp.</p>
<p>Seagate, which makes computer disk drives, then warned that its fourth-quarter results would be below estimates because of weak demand for its high-performance disk drive products and a loss of market share to competitors.  </p>
<p>But the greatest dampening effect on the tech sector came from Intel, the leading computer chip maker, analysts said.</p>
<p>The company said Friday its second-quarter revenues would be lower than its first-quarter revenues of $6.4 billion and that gross margins would be around 60 percent, compared to 64 percent in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Before the company's warning, the First Call consensus estimate for the second quarter was $2.16 per share.</p>
<p>Other major technology stocks that felt the pinch included Dell Computer Corp which shed 5-1/4 to 108-1/8, Microsoft Corp which lost 3-5/8 to 120-3/4, and International Business Machines Corp which shed 2-7/8 to 84-3/8.</p>
