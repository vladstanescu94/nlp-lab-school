<title>USA: ADR REPORT - Telebras rises.</title>
<headline>ADR REPORT - Telebras rises.</headline>

<text>
<p>Brazilian telephone holding Telebras SA rose strongly Thursday, boosted by inflows from Brazilian mutual funds.</p>
<p>Telebras was up 5-3/8 to 159-3/4, above a 12-month closing high. Volume was a moderate one million shares in late morning, putting Telebras's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) among the most active issues on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Telebras has risen steadily in recent weeks. It stood at 121-1/2 on May 14 and has rocketed up from 76-1/2 at the start of the year.  </p>
<p>The stock's recent rise has been caused by &quot;local buyers coming out of the mutual funds in Brazil as interest rates have come down,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Those guys really have been driving it, along with some option buying,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Robert Pelosky, a principal at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said in a June 25 analysis that the amount of Brazilian mutual fund assets invested in equities was on the rise.  </p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, 96 percent of Brazilian mutual funds assets were in fixed-income funds, drawn by the high real yields paid by Brazilian government bonds. However, by the end of May the equity share had risen to 10 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the last 12 months, equity assets have increased by around 400 percent, compared to 51 percent for total assets under management,&quot; Pelosky wrote.</p>
<p>Among other Latin American ADRs, Mexican shares moved higher, boosted in part by rumors that Standard &amp; Poors might upgrade Mexico's long-term currency rating, traders said.</p>
<p>An S&amp;P spokesman denied the rumors.  </p>
<p>Telefonos de Mexico was up 9/16 to 48-1/8, and Vitro SA rose 5/16 to 10-3/8.</p>
<p>French drug and chemical group Rhone-Poulenc SA rose 6-7/8 to a 12-month high of 43 after the company said it would buy the 32 percent of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc it did not already own.</p>
<p>Rhone-Poulenc said it would pay $4.3 billion for the remaining shares. Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's shares rose 11 to 90-7/16 in very heavy volume.  </p>
<p>Among other active ADRs, Singaporean software company Creative Technology Ltd rose one to 17-3/8.</p>
<p>Advancers led decliners 273 to 199 among 814 ADRs. The ADR group rose 0.31 percent and volume in late morning was 32.5 million shares.</p>
<p>ADRs allow U.S. trade of foreign shares.</p>
