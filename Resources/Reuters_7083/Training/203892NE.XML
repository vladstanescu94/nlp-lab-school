<title>USA: Micro Warehouse to restate Q1 96 results.</title>
<headline>Micro Warehouse to restate Q1 96 results.</headline>
<dateline>NORWALK, Conn. 1996-11-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Micro Warehouse Inc said on Tuesday that it planned to restate its first quarter 1996 results to reflect a $3.2 million pre-tax charge for past accounting errors.</p>
<p>On September 30, Micro Warehouse said it would likely restate its financial results for 1994 and 1995 fiscal years after finding errors in accounting procedures.</p>
<p>The company said it found that since 1992 that it incorrectly accounted for accrued inventory liabilities and trade payables. Inaccuracies in these accounts totalled about $47.3 million, Micro Warehouse said.  </p>
<p>The company therefore said it increased its accounts payable by $47.3 million and also recorded an offsetting increase in the company's prepaid income taxes of $19.1 million as of September 30.</p>
<p>But Micro Warehouse said it would have a lower than anticipated charge of $26.8 million in fiscal 1995, instead of $28 million, because it would record a $2.2 million pre-tax credit for rescinding 1995 incentive bonuses paid to certain senior executives.</p>
<p>&quot;The company has been working with its independent auditors and outside advisors with respect to these matters,&quot; said Peter Godfrey, chairman.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that the changes we have made to our systems, procedures and business processes ensure that these accounting errors have not affected the current period and will not affect future results,&quot; he said.</p>
