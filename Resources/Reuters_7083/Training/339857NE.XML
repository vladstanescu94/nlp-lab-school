<headline>Applix off after Q4 results, downgrade.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-29</dateline>

<p>Applix Inc shares lost nearly 25 percent of their value Wednesday after reporting slightly lower-than-expected fourth quarter earnings that resulted in one analyst downgrading the stock to buy from strong buy.</p>
<p>The Westboro, Mass.-based supplier of real-time decision support software reported fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.21 a share, before some acquisition-related charges, versus $0.16 per share a year ago. The consensus among the handful of analysts who follow the company had been $0.22 per share.</p>
<p>Needham analyst John Barr cut the stock to buy from strong buy, but kept his earnings estimate of $0.96 a share for 1997.  </p>
<p>Applix had declined six points to 16-3/4 by late afternoon on unusually high volume for the stock of 3.2 million shares.</p>
<p>Barr said fourth quarter earnings were hurt by accelerated hiring of sales and marketing staff to beef up the company's distribution of new products it has developed in-house and through recent aquisitions.</p>
<p>He said the downgrade resulted from the fourth quarter earnings disappointment and because of some concern about the slow sequential growth in Applix's decision support products.</p>
<p>But Barr downplayed the recent quarter's shortfall as necessary to ensure future revenue growth and as &quot;a bit of product transition issue.&quot;</p>
<p>Soundview analyst Kris Tuttle said the company may take a quarter or two before earnings begin to accelerate again. He maintained his short-term hold and long-term buy on the stock.</p>
<p>Both analysts remained positive on Applix's long-term outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a good quality company.  They are highly profitable and growing at 40 percent per year,&quot; Tuttle said.  &quot;They just came up a little shy of expectations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The company is known for its real-time decision support software tools including Internet access to stock quotes.</p>
