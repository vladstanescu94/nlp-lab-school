<p>Computer Associates International Inc. stock jumped on Tuesday, after the company announced a series of partnerships with major hardware vendors and a related pact with Sun Microsystems Inc.</p>
<p>Shares of the company climbed $5.625, or 9 percent, to $65.625 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the biggest percentage gainers and most active issues.</p>
<p>At the CA World conference in New Orleans, Computer Associates said vendors such as Hewlett-Packard Co., Digital Equipment Corp. and Tandem Computers Inc., among others, will bundle a version of the company's next-generation enterprise management software into their hardware.</p>
<p>The software, called Unicenter TNG (the next generation), is designed to help centrally manage, monitor and control all the information technology resources located worldwide in an organisation, from desktop computers to a mainframe, from local area networks to the Internet.</p>
<p>Separately, the company said it would accelerate the adoption of Sun's Java computer language in a broad partnership to offer a Java-based version of the new software.</p>
<p>Andrew Roskill, an analyst at brokerage Smith Barney, said the Islandia, N.Y.-based company's plan to bundle a stripped-down version of the software with the offerings of a group of hardware vendors was a smart sales strategy.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the Unicenter TNG (announcement) is a pretty new and significant event. They are announcing a partnership with am impressive list of OEM (original equipment manufacturing) hardware partners,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It really positions Computer Associates as the Switzerland of hardware vendors, meaning they are neutral and they work with all the vendors,&quot; Roskill said.</p>
<p>In return, Computer Associates could expose a new group of potential customers to its products.</p>
