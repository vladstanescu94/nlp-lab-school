<p>An array of private sector trade groups charged that the Clinton Administration's new export policy on computer encoding technology was a failure.</p>
<p>Encryption products, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software &quot;key,&quot; are subject to strict export limits, although the administration recently relaxed the rules a bit.</p>
<p>The new policy &quot;does not adequately address the needs of either the American business community or the general public,&quot; the 13 groups said in a letter to Clinton dated Feb 11 and released on Thursday.  </p>
<p>The groups signing the letter included the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers and National Retail Federation, along with a host of high-tech industry groups such as the Business Software Alliance and the Information Technology Association of America.</p>
<p>Center for Democracy and Technology, an advocacy group for civil liberties in cyberspace, and the Association of Research Libraries also signed the letter.</p>
<p>An administration spokeswoman said, despite the complaints, the current policy would be maintained.  </p>
<p>&quot;The administration is moving ahead with our encryption export liberalization policy,&quot; Heidi Kukis said. The policy balances diverse interests by &quot;allowing us to develop exports while protecting our national security,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Under the current policy, U.S. companies cannot export products containing strong encryption, used to protect everything from a business' electronic mail to a consumer's credit card number sent over the Internet, unless the products also allow the government to crack the code by recovering the software keys.  </p>
<p>Companies can get a license to export medium-strength encryption lacking so-called key recovery features if the companies agree to incorporate key recovery in future products within two years.</p>
<p>So far, the Commerce Department has issued three licenses under the two-year provision. Digital Equipment Corp, Trusted Information Systems Inc, and Cylink Corp got the okay's by promising to offer key recovery products by 1999.</p>
<p>International Business Machines Corp and Hewlett Packard Co have said they are also seeking licenses.  </p>
<p>But companies and privacy advocates rejected the administration's key recovery-based approach.</p>
<p>&quot;It fails to accommodate the competitiveness concerns of sellers of encryption products, the security concerns of the buyers of such products, or important privacy rights,&quot; the groups said in their letter.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe a fundamental rethinking of this policy is necessary,&quot; they added. &quot;We remain interested in working with you to achieve a constructive solution to this very difficult problem.&quot;</p>
<p>Congress is already considering proposals that would dramatically relax the export restrictions without requiring key recovery.</p>
<p>The administration has repeatedly said it opposes allowing unfettered strong encryption programs out of the country where they could be used by international crooks and terrorists.</p>
