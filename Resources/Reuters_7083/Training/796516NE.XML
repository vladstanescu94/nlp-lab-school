<p>A computer piracy watchdog accused a top Singapore compact disc maker on Wednesday of being a major player in the Southeast Asian illegal software business following a 15-hour raid.</p>
<p>The Business Software Alliance (BSA) was jubilant after Tuesday's raid on stock market-listed SM Summit by Singapore detectives and industry experts.</p>
<p>&quot;The pirate CD-ROM industry could come to a grinding halt in Southeast Asia following a significant raid on the CD-ROM manufacturing operations of Singapore-listed SM Summit Holdings,&quot; the BSA said in a statement.</p>
<p>SM Summit executives failed to return numerous telephone calls and employees said they had been told to say nothing.</p>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Singapore suspended trade in SM Summit shares after they plunged nearly 38 percent to Singapore $0.655, down S$0.39.</p>
<p>They began falling when market rumours named it as the target of a raid, then plunged when the BSA confirmed that.</p>
<p>The raid was a major operation, involving experts from the United States, Australia and Hong Kong as well as Singapore.</p>
<p>The BSA, which groups major software publishers, said the operation began when it sued SM Summit on behalf of Microsoft, Adobe Systems Inc and Autodesk Inc, accusing it of software piracy.</p>
<p>The Singapore High Court then gave approval for the raid by the detectives accompanied by experts from the BSA and the three American companies, BSA officials told a news conference.</p>
<p>The latest BSA figures say that more than half of software programmes used in Singapore are counterfeit.</p>
<p>They say that while piracy rates have fallen in Asia as a whole -- often from very high bases -- they have risen six percentage points in Singapore, from 53 percent in 1995 to 59 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>SM Summit, listed on Singapore's second board, is one of the biggest manufacturers and suppliers of compact discs, technically the same as CD-ROMs, in Singapore.</p>
<p>In its latest financial report, in May 1997, the company claimed a 70-percent share of the Singapore market.</p>
<p>&quot;It has built up a reputation of trustworthiness over the years. This is very important in capturing and retaining the businesses of multi-national recording labels,&quot; its 1996 annual report said.</p>
<p>&quot;We filed two civil suits yesterday,&quot; BSA's Singapore lawyer Sheena Jacob told the news conference.</p>
<p>One suit was against SM Summit and the other against another local company, FAS Disc Manufacturing (S) Pte Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;Both actions are connected to CD-ROM manufacture, illegal CD-ROM manufacture,&quot; said BSA regional lawyer Lee Cross.</p>
<p>BSA and Microsoft started to investigate SM Summit following tip-offs that the company was involved in software piracy, the lawyers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We convinced a judge to provide us with a search warrant. It allowed us to seize substantial documents,&quot; said Ron Eckstrom, Microsoft's Sydney-based lawyer.</p>
<p>He said the raid uncovered boxes of documents that could be evidence of illegality, including records of manufacturing and sale of suspected counterfeit CD-ROMS at Summit's premises.</p>
<p>BSA officials said Microsoft had worked with informants and managed to secure evidence against Summit, revealing the names of customers and their orders.</p>
<p>The BSA statement said eight &quot;stampers&quot; -- used for the replication of CD-ROMs -- were seized during the raid.</p>
<p>&quot;Each stamper can be used to replicate tens of thousands of CD-ROMs,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Five of the stampers were believed to contain counterfeit software products and compilations of programmes copyrighted by BSA members, it said.</p>
