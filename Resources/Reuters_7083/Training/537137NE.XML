<p>Internet software company Netscape Communications Corp. Wednesday reported a 119 percent surge in first-quarter profits to $7.9 million, boosted by new business on its Web site and corporate sales growth.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jim Barksdale said in a statement the company's server -- or network host computer software -- business continued to grow, accounting for roughly 38 percent of the company's revenues for the quarter.</p>
<p>Mountain View, Calif.-based Netscape's earnings, equal to 9 cents a share, compared with $3.6 million, or 4 cents a share in the first quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Revenues totalled $120.2 million, a 114 percent increase over the $56.1 million in revenues generated a year ago. Industry analysts on average had expected Netscape to post earnings of 8 cents a share.</p>
<p>Netscape reported growth in revenues from new businesses that will attract viewers to its Web site for informaiton as well as products, including a deal with Yahoo! Inc. to provide an Internet information navigation service.</p>
<p>That deal was among the factors that helped boost services to 25 percent of revenues from 16 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Peter Currie said services and the Web site were important financial contributors.</p>
<p>The earnings were released after the market close.</p>

<p>The stock remained steady in after-hours trade, trading in a band of $27.375 to $27.625.</p>
