<p>Computer Associates International Inc., a leading maker of software for businesses, said Monday it agreed to pay about $1.2 billion for Cheyenne Software Inc.</p>
<p>Computer Associates, the largest independent maker of business software for mainframe computers, said it will offer $30.50 in cash for each share of Cheyenne. Cheyenne's stock jumped $7.625 to $30 on the American Stock Exchange, while Computer Associates gained $1.75 to $64.50 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.</p>
<p>While investors applauded the announcement, industry analysts said they were puzzled by what they viewed as the expensive price Computer Associates agreed to pay.</p>
<p>&quot;This is departure from their standard practice,&quot; said UBS Securities analyst Joseph Farley. &quot;They are paying more than they ever have. There's clearly some synergies,&quot; he added. &quot;The question is whether those synergies are worth seven times sales.&quot;</p>
<p>Cheyenne reported revenues of $174.1 million in its fiscal year ending June 1996.</p>
<p>The deal, which has been rumored for several months, has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both Cheyenne, based in Roslyn, N.Y., and Islip, N.Y.-based Computer Associates, the companies said.</p>
<p>Cheyenne makes storage management, anti-virus and communications software products designed to run on client/server networks in which personal computers are tied together in a network run by a larger computer, or server.</p>
<p>Computer Associates said Cheyenne's products will bolster its own systems management software offerings, which run on both client/server and mainframe computer networks. Computer Associates derives a majority of its revenues from mainframe software.</p>
<p>Computer Associates Chairman Charles Wang said in a conference call that Cheyenne Chief Executive ReiJane Huai, whom he called a &quot;dear friend,&quot; planned to remain as head of Cheyenne once the merger was completed and Cheyenne became a subsidiary of Computer Associates.</p>
<p>Wang said his company planned to retain all 800 of Cheyenne's employees. Computer Associates employs about 9,000 people worldwide. Both companies are based on New York's Long Island.</p>
<p>Wang pointed to significant synergies to be realized between the two companies' products and what he described as their complementary distribution models, while noting that there were no existing product overlaps.</p>
<p>He contrasted Computer Associates' focus on &quot;infrastructure software,&quot; used to manage entire corporate enterprises, with Cheyenne's more consumer-oriented focus on supplying storage management, anti-virus and commmunications software products.</p>
<p>Computer Associates said it will fund the acquisition through cash balances and existing credit facilities.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Cheyenne successively waged an aggressive fight to fend off a $1 billion unwelcome takeover bid by McAffee Associates Inc, a rival maker of systems management and anti-virus software.</p>
<p>Cheyenne's Huai said the $1.2 billion Computer Associates offer was &quot;solid&quot; compared with McAfee Associates Inc.'s offer, which was worth about $1 billion in stock and subject to stock price fluctuations.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not shopping the company,&quot; Huai said.</p>
<p>Since 1976, Computer Associates has grown through a campaign of approximately 60 acquisitions to become of the world's leading independent supplier of software.</p>
<p>Paul Mason, a software analyst with technology research firm International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass., said the latest acquisition does not fit what he called &quot;the CA model, both in terms of acquisitions and product strategy.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to see where this fits in. If they were getting this at a great price, I could understand the deal,&quot; he said.</p>
