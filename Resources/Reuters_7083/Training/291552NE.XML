<title>USA: Citation Computer sees Q3 operating loss.</title>
<headline>Citation Computer sees Q3 operating loss.</headline>
<dateline>ST. LOUIS, Mo. 1997-01-07</dateline>

<p>Citation Computer Systems Inc said Tuesday it expects to report a loss for the third quarter ended December 31 in the range of $0.30 to $0.32 a share, excluding a loss of $0.09 a share for costs from a secondary stock offering that was withdrawn.</p>
<p>Citation also said it expects to report revenues for the quarter of about $4.0 million, down about 38 percent from the year-ago fiscal third quarter.  </p>
<p>In the year-ago third quarter, Citation earned $0.22 a share on revenues of $6.5 million.</p>
<p>Citation said the decline in third quarter results was due to reduced system sales, domestically and internationally, compared with record sales in both areas in the prior year.</p>
<p>Earnings were also hurt by lower margins and higher development expenses, which resulted from the increased cost of developing new products and a lower capitalization rate.</p>
<p>J. Robert Cooper, Citation chairman, said lower revenues reflect both a general slowdown in the marketplace and a startup period for sales programs.</p>
<p>&quot;I remain optimistic about Citation's prospects for the future,&quot; Cooper added. &quot;It will take another quarter or so for the impact of Citation's new products and programs to be reflected in our operating performance.&quot;</p>
<p>He added he believes, in the long term, the company continues to be well positioned to take advantage of emerging trends in the healthcare information systems industry.</p>
<p>Citation added it expects several products, including its CURES community registration system, C-RIS radiology system, and its enhanced C-COM clinical communications system, to begin shipping early in fiscal 1998.</p>
