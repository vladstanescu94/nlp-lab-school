<title>USA: Summit Medical to restate '96 revenues.</title>
<headline>Summit Medical to restate '96 revenues.</headline>
<dateline>MINNEAPOLIS 1997-03-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Summit Medical Systems Inc said Monday it expects to revise downward previously reported revenues for the year ended December 31, 1996, and likely will also correct downward revenue reported for 1995 and 1994.</p>
<p>Last last month, Summit reported revenues for 1996 of $19,543,000, up from $17,696,000 in 1995.</p>
<p>Summit said it expects 1996 revenues for the year will be &quot;substantially less&quot; than the amount previously reported, after further examining preliminary results for the year.  </p>
<p>Preliminarily, Summit said, revenue for the years ended 1994, 1995 and 1996 have been overstated in the aggregate by $4,000,000 to $6,000,000.  This estimated overstatement of revenues represents eight to 12 percent of aggregate revenues for 1994, 1995 and 1996.</p>
<p>The exact size of the adjustments to revenue and the years in which they apply will not be determined until the company's audit is completed, it added.</p>
<p>The company said that Donald Haas, chief financial officer, who started with the company on February 27, informed management that some 1996 revenue was incorrectly recognized.  </p>
<p>Summit said its management immediately began a review of these questions.</p>
<p>Haas resigned as chief financial officer of the company on March 1.   A search for a new chief financial officer has</p>
<p>begun, and the company may seek an interim replacement.</p>
<p>The Audit Committee of the board of directors was informed of these issues on the same day, and the company engaged Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP to initiate an investigation with the assistance of independent accounting advice.  </p>
<p>Arthur Andersen LLP has been retained by Dorsey &amp; Whitney to advise it in its investigation.  The company's auditors, Ernst &amp; Young LLP, have expanded the scope of their audit and are performing additional procedures based in part on the questions raised by Haas, Summit said.</p>
<p>Summit said its board met on Sunday, March 2, to review the status of the investigation and the audit.</p>
<p>The company said questions over revenues result from the erroneous application of its revenue recognition accounting policies to sales of software and related services, and not to activities of BSM Consulting Group and C. L. McIntosh &amp; Associates, its consulting subsidiaries.</p>
<p>The results of the company's investigation are preliminary and it intends to continue its internal investigation under the direction of its Audit Committee, Summit said.</p>
<p>Summit Medical provides systems and information services for the healthcare industry.  Its integrated packages of database technology and consultative services allow clients to capture, manage and report clinical, economic and patient-reported outcomes.</p>
<p>Summit said it currently offers more than 40 products and services used by over 1,700 customers worldwide.</p>
