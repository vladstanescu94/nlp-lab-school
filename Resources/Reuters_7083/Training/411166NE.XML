<p>Intuit Inc said on Thursday revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 1997 will be slower than previously expected because of continued softness in consumer software products.</p>
<p>In a conference call with analysts and reporters, executives of the Mountain View, California-based personal finance and tax software provider said they expected revenues of $600 million to $620 million for the fiscal year ending in July.</p>
<p>While that represented an improvement from fiscal 1996 revenues of $553 milion, it would mark a slowdown from the first half of fiscal 1997 when Intuit had revenues of $368 million.</p>
<p>But officials said they believed the company would be able to continue to reduce expenses in line with the slower revenues to keep fiscal 1997 earnings in tune with analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>According to First Call, which tracks Wall Street estimates, analysts expected Intuit to earn around $0.80 a share in fiscal 1997, up from $0.68 a share in fiscal 1996 before adjustments.</p>
<p>Earlier, Intuit reported second quarter profits of $1.10 a share, excluding acquisition-related expenses and a gain on discontinued operations. That compared with a profit of $0.85 a share, before one-time items, a year ago.</p>
<p>Because Intuit's performance is tied heavily to the tax season, the second quarter is normally the most profitable period for the company and it is common for Intuit to post a loss in other quarters.</p>
<p>Chief financial officer James Heeger said some of the income previously expected in the third quarter could shift into the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Sales of Quicken, Intuit's popular personal finance software, were strong for Windows-based computers, with retail unit sales up 14 percent in the second quarter ending in January.</p>
<p>However, Intuit said sales for Macintosh-based computers were lower and, coupled with lower average selling prices and lower sales of Intuit's non-Quicken products, led to a slight decline in revenues for the company's personal finance business.</p>
<p>&quot;The company is cautious about further growth in personal finance as we expect softness in consumer software during the remainder of the year,&quot; Heeger said.</p>
<p>He said second quarter revenues from Intuit's Parsons products, while up 10 percent from a year ago, were below expectations because of softer direct mail response rates. Intuit said it expected this trend to continue through to the year's end.</p>
<p>Intuit's personal tax segment reported a 16 percent rise in net revenues for the second quarter, reflecting higher retail sell-through rates. It said a rival product called Tax-Cut was being heavily promoted by H&amp;R Block and it remained to be seen how long H&amp;R Block would continue to offer the discounts.</p>
<p>Intuit's professional tax software segment reported &quot;double- digit&quot; revenue growth in the second quarter and the company said its small business product revenues were up more than 40 percent in the quarter because of the release of QuickBooks 5.0.</p>
<p>The company said its Internet-based business showed dramatic growth in the second quarter and it expected the Internet segment to assume a more important role in the future.</p>
