<title>USA: Netscape falls after warning on growth.</title>

<p>Netscape Communications Corp. stock lost 15 percent of its value Friday after the Internet software maker warned of slower growth in sales and earnings and a loss of customers to rival Microsoft Corp.</p>
<p>In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late on Thursday, Netscape said higher spending for research and development, sales, marketing and customer support will prevent it from sustaining its historical growth rates.</p>
<p>It also said Microsoft's rival products had cut into its market and may materially reduce its market share. Microsoft has increased its share of the Web browser market to around 30 percent, according to the latest independent surveys, although Netscape still has a dominant role.</p>
<p>Netscape shares fell $5.3125 to $29.25 on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>Some analysts said they expected the stock will continue to be under pressure, perhaps testing its 52-week low of $23.50 in coming weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;I would not be surprised to see the stock minimally test its lows for the year,&quot; said Rick Berry of Murphey Marseilles Smith. &quot;Investors have been fearful of this scenario but this is the first time they've seen it in print.&quot;</p>
<p>Netscape is shifting its focus to serving business customers rather than home computer users. As a result, the company said revenues are likely to fluctuate from one quarter to the next as business conditions change.</p>
