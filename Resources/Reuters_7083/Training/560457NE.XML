<p>Shares of BMC Software Inc jumped about nine percent on Monday in anticipation of the company's meeting with Wall Street analysts on Tuesday, analysts said.</p>
<p>BMC Software gained 4-1/8 to 49-5/8, with almost twice the normal daily volume of shares traded by early afternoon.</p>
<p>Analysts said they were not aware of any specific announcements BMC will make on Tuesday, but they suggested the meeting in Houston will likely add to the positive momentum surrounding the company.  </p>
<p>&quot;I'm not sure that there will be anything that significant, but people are expecting that investors will gain a renewed sense of confidence,&quot; said Andrew Roskill, an analyst with Smith Barney.</p>
<p>William Conroy, an analyst with Williams MacKay Jordan &amp; Co, said he expects BMC to highlight its future goals and could make some comments regarding new products or new partnerships, he said.</p>
<p>Analysts said they are bullish on BMC, citing its 38 percent increase in fourth quarter earnings. For the fourth quarter ened March 31, BMC posted fourth quarter earnings of $53.4 million on total revenues of $160.6 million, compared with $38.7 million on revenues of $128.3 million during the same period last year.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some areas that they are going into that look real lucrative.  Business has been very strong for them,&quot; Conroy said.</p>
<p>BMC Software, a database management company, could not be reached for comment.</p>
