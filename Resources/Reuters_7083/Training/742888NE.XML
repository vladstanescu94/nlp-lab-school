<p>Microsoft Corp. has purchased a 10 percent stake in Internet start-up Progressive Networks Inc. in a deal aimed at unifying standards for delivering audio and video.</p>
<p>Company officials declined to give financial details, but one analyst estimated Microsoft invested $30 million for a non-voting stake in the 3-year-old Seattle company known for its RealAudio and RealVideo &quot;streaming&quot; multimedia technology.</p>
<p>Under a licensing arrangement, Microsoft will include Progressive Networks technology in forthcoming versions of its Internet Explorer browser and its NetShow server, and the two companies will work together to ensure their software remains compatible.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a great deal for both companies,&quot; said Allen Weiner, Internet analyst at market research firm Dataquest.</p>
<p>Progressive Networks gets guaranteed &quot;massive distribution&quot; of its free client software, while Microsoft wins support for its new Active Streaming Format from Progressive and probably from the many news and entertainment companies that provide RealAudio and RealVideo content.</p>
<p>Progressive Networks was founded in 1994 and quickly made its mark with RealAudio, which allowed Internet users to hear audio clips with only a slight delay for buffering.</p>
<p>Before such streaming technology became widespread, users had to download audio files before they could be played back, which made lengthy voice or music clips impractical.</p>
<p>Glaser, a former Microsoft vice president, said his company holds an 85 percent share of the market for streaming audio players, with some 20 million copies downloaded free over the Internet. The company also has sold 500,000 copies of an upgrade version at about $30 each, he said.</p>
<p>The company gets most of its revenues from sales of server, or network computer, products to content providers and other customers.</p>
<p>Glaser said Progressive Networks was poised to play a key role in the television and radio of the future, which he predicted would be delivered over Internet-style networks.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the digital convergence that everyone is talking about, we're thrilled with the start we've got, but that's tiny compared with where we're going,&quot; he said in a conference call with analysts and reporters.</p>
<p>Dwight Davis, editor of Windows Watcher, a newsletter that follows Microsoft, said the agreement between the two companies averts a potential standards war.</p>
<p>&quot;They really were on a collision course, and they've come to an accommodation,&quot; he said. &quot;Probably a lot of content providers are breathing a sigh of relief that the two have worked out their differences.&quot;</p>
