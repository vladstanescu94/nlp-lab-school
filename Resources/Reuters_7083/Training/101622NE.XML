<p>Systems &amp; Computer Technology Corp said on Tuesday that it expected its fully diluted fourth quarter fiscal 1996 earnings to be between $0.20 and $0.21 per share, due to strength in its higher education businesses and in its utility license revenues.  </p>
<p>The company said it expected its revenues would be about $58 million in the fourth quarter and $215 million in the fiscal year. Both figures were company records, it said.</p>
<p>Systems also said its cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term debt, would be about $10 million, reflecting a $19 million increase from the balance at June 30.  </p>
<p>But the company said its local government and manufacturing divisions did not close anticipated levels of new business in the quarter, as they tried to become a cohesive unit.</p>
<p>Systems &amp; Computer, which was not immediately available to comment further, said its education and utility business had a strong quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;Once again, our education division exhibited its leadership position in the higher education market with record revenue and profits for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year,&quot; said Michael Emmi, Systems &amp; Computer chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Emmi also its utility busines enjoyed its second-highest licence fee quarter and its best six months of license fee revenue ever.</p>
