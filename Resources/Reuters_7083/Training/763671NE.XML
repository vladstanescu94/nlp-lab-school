<p>A search for a new CEO is under way. Meanwhile, company director John Nehra will serve as acting chief executive, Summit said.</p>

<p>Nehra is managing partner of Catalyst Ventures LP and a general partner of New Enterprise Associates, both venture capital limited partnerships.  </p>
<p>The company said it has formed an office of the president comprised of several corporate officers who will report to Nehra. &quot;A committee of directors will conduct a CEO search and present its recommendation to the entire board. The committee consists of Nehra and Connery,&quot; Summit said.</p>
<p>&quot;Although in recent months the company has experienced significant difficulties, the board is committed to moving forward with a new CEO and the company's executive management team to build on the company's established customer base and technology portfolio,&quot; Nehra said.</p>
