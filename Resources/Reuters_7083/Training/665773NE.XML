<title>USA: Workstation market grew 30 percent in Q1-Dataquest.</title>
<headline>Workstation market grew 30 percent in Q1-Dataquest.</headline>
<dateline>SAN JOSE, Calif. 1997-06-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>The market for workstations based on Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT more than doubled in the first quarter, helping push worldwide sales of workstation computers 30 percent higher than they were in the first quarter of last year, Dataquest said.</p>
<p>The San Jose, Calif.-based market research and consulting firm said the market for Windows NT workstations surged by 242 percent as Intel Corp.'s Pentium Pro systems enabled these systems to compete.  </p>
<p>Still, Sun Micrososystems Inc. continued to dominate the workstation arena with 33.2 percent of the market on a units shipped basis, Dataquest said.</p>
<p>Workstations are powerful number-crunching computers used mostly by engineers and designers for applications ranging from special effects for films to designing jet aircraft. The workstation market has traditionally been dominated by computers designed around reduced instruction set (RISC) processors and variants of the Unix operating system.  </p>
<p>In the first quarter, these systems still accounted for 195,442 shipments or 75 percent of unit volumes and $3 billion or 86.7 percent of worldwide workstation revenue, according to Dataquest's market estimates.</p>
<p>Generally cheaper Windows NT-based systems accounted for 23.6 percent of units shipped in the first quarter of 1997, according to Dataquest, although due to lower price points they accounted for just 12.4 percent of workstation revenues.</p>
<p>Dataquest analyst Peter ffoulkes said the advent of higher performance NT workstations had blurred the boundaries between high-end PC configurations and Unix systems.  </p>
<p>&quot;With the introduction of Pentium Pro, Intel-based systems could complete on an equal footing with entry-level RISC systems, accelerating the penetration of Windows NT into the Unix-dominated workstation market,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Unix shipment volumes grew by 10 percent in the first quarter, Dataquest said, improving on a moribund performance in 1996, when three of the top five vendors upgraded their product lines and total Unix-based shipments and revenues actually fell from the previous year.  </p>
<p>Sun Micrososystems continued to lead the market with workstation unit shipments up 25.8 percent from a year ago at 86,245, Dataquest estimated.</p>
<p>This accounted for 33.2 percent of the market on a units shipped basis, and its estimated revenues of $1.22 billion was up 26.7 percent from first quarter 1996 and comprised 35.3 percent of worldwide workstation revenues.</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard Co., which unlike Sun produces NT-based workstations and Unix products, was in second place, selling 54,124 units, up 20 percent.  </p>
<p>However, estimates had Hewlett-Packard revenues down by 8.6 percent from first quarter 1996 to $752 million -- equal to 21.7 percent of the market.</p>
<p>Silicon Graphics was third in worldwide revenues and fourth in unit shipments, at 12 percent of revenues and 8.3 percent of unit shipments, while International Business Machines Corp was third in volumes shipped and fourth in revenues in first quarter, according to Dataquest.  </p>
<p>In the Windows NT workstation market, Hewlett-Packard was the leading vendor in terms of units shipped in the first quarter, with 22,898 units or 37.3 percent of the total but was number three in revenues with 23.5 percent of the market.</p>
<p>Intergraph Group Inc. led in total revenues with $113 million, or 25.3 percent of the market, although it was fourth in units with 7,586, or 12.4 percent.</p>
<p>Compaq Computer Corp. was second in both Windows NT workstation columns, with 17,811 units shipped accountinf for 29 percent of industry shipments in the first quarter and revenues of $107 million, or 24.9 percent.</p>
<p>Digital Equipment Corp. was ranked third in volume of NT workstations with 8,824, or 14.4 percent, and fourth in revenues with $78 million, or 18.1 percent. In the total worldwide workstation market, Digital held onto fifth spot.</p>
