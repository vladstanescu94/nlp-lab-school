<headline>UK's Internet Bookshop in virtual share offering.</headline>

<p>The Internet Bookshop, a book retailer, said on Thursday it had became the first company in Europe to offer its shares to the British public across the Internet.</p>
<p>But due to security in the fledgling world of business across the Internet, those hoping to subscribe will have to download a form, fill it in by hand, attach a cheque, and mail it, not e-mail it, by old-fashioned post or &quot;snail-mail&quot; as web fans call it.</p>
<p>The share offering is being used as a showcase for Microsoft Corp Internet technology, according to Microsoft Europe's marketing manager Andrew King. &quot;The Internet Bookshop is a great example of a company that built their business on Microsoft's Internet platform,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Internet Bookshop is the world's second largest distributor of books across the Internet after Amazon in the United States, with over 850,000 titles available.</p>
<p>But while the firm's list of titles includes every book published in the UK, business and academic publications account for around 70 percent of the company's trade.</p>
<p>Under the offering private investors will each be able to apply to purchase up to 9,500 Internet Bookshop shares at one pound ($1.61) each out of a total of 250,000 set aside for the general public.</p>
<p>And for those purchasing 500 or more, the company is offering a 10 percent discount on any of its books, according to Darryl Mattocks, founder and managing director of The Internet Bookshop.</p>
<p>Listed on Microsoft UK's home-page and on the world-wide web at www.bookshop.co.uk, the Internet Bookshop is selling a total of one million shares which will trade on OFEX, a private stock exchange listing small UK companies and operated by brokerage JP Jenkins.</p>
<p>Mattocks said 750,000 of the shares had been placed with a number of institutional investors in the UK and abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first time in Europe that shares will be offered across the Internet with the consent of all regulatory bodies,&quot; Mattocks said.</p>
<p>Previously an IT consultant, Mattocks set up the Internet Bookshop in 1993, but when it came on-line in June 1994 business was initially very slow.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn't sell a single book for the first two months,&quot; Mattock said. But the tide seems to have turned, and January produced the company's best ever sales.</p>
<p>The firm sold 7,492 books during the period, producing sales of 120,000 pounds.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking for turnover to increase at least four-fold during 1997,&quot; Mattocks said. Turnover during 1996 totalled 568,162 pounds on sales of 19,000 books.</p>
<p>Proceeds of the share offering will help reduce the company's 200,000 pounds debts and will fund the 100,000 sterling flotation, leaving the firm with a balance of 700,000 sterling, Mattocks said.</p>
