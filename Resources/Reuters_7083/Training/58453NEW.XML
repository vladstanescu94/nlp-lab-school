<p>Sales of computer equipment used to connect workers at home or on the road with a central office are booming, with worldwide revenue hitting $941 million in the first quarter, Dataquest said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The market for such equipment, called remote access systems, has become one of the fastest-growing parts in the networking industry, and is on track to nearly double 1995's revenue of $2.6 billion, the computer market research firm said.</p>
<p>&quot;Growth in the remote access market will continue to accelerate through the end of the century as new users drive demand for equipment,&quot; said Bobbi Murphy, director and principal analyst in San Jose, Calif.-based Dataquest's Remote Access programme.</p>
<p>&quot;The glut of new users also will drive demand for larger, more integrated systems that can handle higher call loads and provide integrated access to LAN and WAN backbones.&quot;</p>
<p>LANs, or local area networks, connect computers within an office, while WANs, or wide area networks, provide links beyond an office.</p>
<p>Cisco Systems was the market leader for the first quarter with revenues of $309.3 million, or 33 percent of the market, Dataquest said.</p>
<p>Ascend Communications had $100.33 million in revenues, or an 11 percent market share. Bay Networks followed with $88.71 million, or 9 percent.</p>
<p>Cisco's lead is attributed to its dominance in the branch office router segment, which accounts for 54 percent of the entire remote access systems market, Dataquest said.</p>
<p>The fastest-growing segment of the remote access systems market is for equipment known as concentrators, which draw together incoming voice or Internet communications into a single console at a central location, Dataquest said.</p>
<p>The concentrator market grew 88 percent in the second half of 1995 from the previous six months, making it the fastest-growing segment of remote access systems, it said. In the first quarter of 1996, remote access concentrators revenue has already reached $208 million.</p>
<p>Dataquest is a unit of Gartner Group Co.</p>
