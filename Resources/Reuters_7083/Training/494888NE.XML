<p>Microsoft Corp Chairman Bill Gates on Tuesday will outline the software giant's latest plans to combat plans for network computers that are far cheaper to operate that standard personal computers.</p>
<p>In a speech to a conference in San Francisco, Gates will expand on the company's plans to support &quot;Windows terminals,&quot; a new class of diskless devices for users who do not need the full capability of personal computers, a company executive said.</p>
<p>Windows terminals, which Gates mentioned briefly in a speech last week, would be cheaper and less capable than the NetPC protocol developed by Microsoft and Intel Corp in an earlier thrust against the NC movement.</p>
<p>While NetPCs are designed to have a sealed case preventing individual users from reconfiguring them, they are similar to today's personal computers in that they allow local storage of applications and data.</p>
<p>The slimmed-down Windows terminal would have no hard disk and only enough memory to draw applications and data from a server computer which would &quot;take over the machine,&quot; said Adam Taylor, a Microsoft group product manager.</p>
<p>One trade industry publication said the devices would cost less than $500.</p>
<p>Taylor said the devices would be supported by technology to be included in version 5.0 of the Windows NT Server operating system, expected out next year. The client terminals would run a version of Windows yet to be determined, Taylor said.</p>
<p>Microsoft is negotiating with Citrix Systems Inc. to license the technology needed to support multiuser capability in Windows NT but also has its own development team working on the software.</p>
<p>Citrix stock fell 60 percent in February after the company disclosed that Microsoft was considering developing its own multiuser technology.</p>
<p>Taylor said the Windows terminals porogram is part of Microsoft &quot;Zero-administration Windows&quot; initiative aimed at reducing the total cost of ownership of personal computers.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole idea of total cost of ownership is obviously something that is prevalent in the minds of (Information Technology) administrators at this time,&quot; Taylor said. -- Martin Wolk, Reuters Seattle bureau, 206-386-4848</p>
