<p>A police raid and a hail of charges -- vehemently denied -- of software piracy against a top compact disc maker has put Singapore in the spotlight as a bootleggers base.</p>
<p>Five years ago, most illegal software used to be traced to Taiwan, officials of the computer industry watchdog Business Software Alliance (BSA) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Three years ago, China was most blamed.</p>
<p>&quot;The disturbing trend over the last year is that the counterfeit software is being traced back to Singapore, Malaysia, and also Indonesia,&quot; said Ron Eckstrom, a lawyer for Microsoft.</p>
<p>His company was a prime mover in Tuesday's raid on compact disc maker SM Summit Holdings, target of a BSA civil suit alleging software piracy that led to a court authorised search warrant and a 15-hour search of its premises.</p>
<p>Summit adamantly denied any wrongdoing, saying it had strict security measures in place to prevent software piracy in its manufacture of audio compact discs and CD-ROMs for the computer industry, about 20 percent of its business.</p>
<p>But whether guilty or not, the Summit raid has highlighted Singapore's alleged role in the highly lucrative bootlegging business, which costs big companies huge amounts of money.</p>
<p>Just how much was emphasised by Cedric Chan, Singapore executive managing director of Autodesk, one of the other American companies involved in the suit against Summit.</p>
<p>Chan said Autodesk's newly launched AutoCAD Release 14 programme used by architects and engineers, which retails for more than US$3,000, was copied and sold very shortly after its launch for a mere Singapore $14 (US$9.30)</p>
<p>&quot;There is potential in using Singapore as a distribution hub for the region,&quot; he said. This was why Singapore's piracy rate had been rising.</p>
<p>The BSA said that while piracy rates were generally dropping in Asia -- admittedly from high bases -- they were rising in Singapore, where illegal software use rose from 53 percent in 1995 to 59 percent in 1996, the highest rise in Asia.</p>
<p>This cost software companies an estimated US$56 million in lost retail sales in Singapore, the BSA said.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been a major activist in attempts to crack down in Singapore, working with police on raids of computer stores.</p>
<p>&quot;Microsoft has declared war on Sim Lim Square and we've been conducting raids every month there like clockwork,&quot; Eckstrom said, referring to a building crammed with computer shops.</p>
<p>In efforts to curb piracy, the BSA offers up to S$20,000 for leads that result in convictions and encourages companies to sign up for a corporate audit programme, giving them some immunity from being sued if illegal items are found later.</p>
<p>It was such a tip-off that led to the probe of Summit.</p>
<p>Courts have also adopted stiffer penalties -- jail terms of up to 36 months and S$181,000 (US$120,000) in fines.</p>
<p>Analysts said that whether guilty or not, Summit's reputation had been hurt and its projected profits would have to be revised. The company's 1996 net profit soared 86 percent to S$10.11 million for the financial year ended December 31, 1996.</p>
<p>They said confidence that a customer's copyright would be protected was critical in the software manufacturing business.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of piracy in the CD-audio industry. They might lose a lot of customers as confidence in them was one of the reasons they did so well,&quot; said Ian Tham, an analyst with Fraser Securities.</p>
<p>He said Summit's margins were &quot;fantastic&quot; at 20 percent, helped by efforts to protect against piracy such as making and releasing CD's at the same time in different countries.</p>
