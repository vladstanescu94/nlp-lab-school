<p>The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating Microsoft Corp.'s recent purchases in the video streaming market and has served several companies with subpoenas in the past 10 days, the department and persons close to the case said Monday.</p>
<p>The antitrust investigation centers on whether Microsoft's recent acquisition and investments in video streaming software companies are anti-competitive.</p>
<p>Video streaming enables Internet users to watch moving pictures on their computer screens, like on television, without first having to download the material, which can take several minutes or even hours.</p>
<p>The technology is particularly useful to recording companies and movie studios that want to preview promotions on the Internet without compromising copyrights.</p>
<p>&quot;We're looking at the proposed transactions,&quot; Gina Talamona of the Justice Department told Reuters on Monday.</p>
<p>The investigation is focusing on Microsoft's acquisition of VXtreme Inc., a Silicon Valley developer of technology for sending audio and video over the Internet, as well as an earlier deal to buy a 10 percent stake Progressive Networks. The transactions are part of a plan aimed at unifying standards for delivering audio and video.</p>
<p>Progressive Networks Inc.'s President Bruce Jacobsen told Reuters Monday the company was subpoenaed on Aug. 8 as part of the investigation.</p>
<p>&quot;Progressive Networks is one of several companies that have been subpoenaed by the Department of Justice for its records related to streaming media and Microsoft,&quot; Jacobsen said.</p>
<p>Progressive Networks is the maker of RealAudio and RealVideo software, which enable Internet users to listen to sounds and watch video live on the Internet.</p>
<p>While VXtreme and is a fledgling development company, Progressive Networks is well known on the Internet with its RealAudio and RealVideo software incorporated into most multimedia sites on the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said he is confident the probe will have a positive outcome for Microsoft.</p>
<p>&quot;We are confident that the Justice Department, once they have reviewed the situation, will agree that all this competition is good for consumers,&quot; Murray said.</p>
<p>Murray said there were many start-up companies developing streaming technology, as well as large firms such as Oracle Corp., International Business Machines Corp., Netscape Communications Corp. and Sun Microsystems.</p>
<p>The Justice Department also said it was investigating Microsoft's investment in VDOnet, the developer of a technology that overcomes key limitations on Internet communications, as well as Microsoft's $150 million investment in former archrival Apple Computer Inc..</p>
<p>Since the late 1980s, Microsoft regularly has drawn close scrutiny from the Justice Department each time it has attempted to make an acquisition.</p>
<p>Critics claim Microsoft's Windows platform, which appears on almost every PC sold, gives it an unfair market advantage.</p>
<p>By adding features to Windows, Microsoft eliminates the market for separate products, competitors argue.</p>
