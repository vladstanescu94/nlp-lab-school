<p>Technology experts warned on Wednesday that companies could fail and a significant part of the economy could collapse if British businesses do not adapt their computer systems to cope with the so-called &quot;Millennium Bug&quot;.</p>
<p>Businesses are complacent and the danger of computers failing to recognise calendar date changes after December 31, 1999 has been greatly underestimated, they warned.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an extraordinarily worrying matter,&quot; wrote Robin Guenier, head of the government body Taskforce 2000, in a letter to the Financial Times published on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Business today is dependent on its computing infrastructure. Systems that are not fixed will fall. Many businesses would not survive such failures,&quot; said Guenier, whose team was set up to deal with the problem.</p>
<p>Because most computers were originally programmed to recognise only the two final digits in a year, such as 97 for 1997, they will recognise the year 2000 as 00, and read this as 1900 -- unless they have been reprogrammed.</p>
<p>&quot;The 'millennium bug' is more real and pervasive than the general media would have us believe,&quot; said Roderick Jones of The TRUST Group, a financial trading company and Karl Feilder, managing director of Greenwich Mean Time, in a joint letter to the Financial Times.</p>
<p>A draft law aimed at forcing businesses to deal with the problem was blocked in parliament last week, when a junior trade minister argued it would impose unwanted burdens on business.</p>
<p>The Financial Times, in an editorial, agreed. It said governments should not be expected to solve an information technology problem, adding &quot;a legislative approach is too heavy handed.&quot;</p>
<p>But Alistair O'Reilly, managing director of Access Accounting, said the government had missed a vital chance to ensure Britain was better prepared for the millennium, and the cost to industry, the economy and Britain's reputation abroad would be high.</p>
<p>Experts estimate it could cost $600 billion to correct the problem worldwide. In Belgium, one of the smaller members of the European Union, Economy Minister Elio di Rupo said it will cost Belgian companies and public authorities at least 19 billion francs ($538.9 million).</p>
<p>He warned that this was a conservative estimate based on partial replies from public administrations and professional organisations.</p>
<p>In Britain, Guenier said a survey by the Department of Trade and Industry showed less than 10 percent of businesses had done an audit of the impact of the problem, which is only the first step towards solving the problem.</p>
