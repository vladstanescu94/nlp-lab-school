<p>Fulcrum Technologies Inc said on Monday it expects to report a loss for its fiscal fourth quarter due to lower than expected sales.</p>
<p>Fulcrum said it now expects to report revenues of about C$15.5 million for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 1996.</p>
<p>It said including a non-recurring charge of about C$15 million, the loss from operations in the quarter is expected to be C$21 million, and the after-tax net loss is expected to be C$13.5 million or C$0.90 per share.</p>
<p>Fulcrum said it expects to report final audited results for the fourth quarter and for the year on Feb 10.</p>
<p>The charge is due to the write-off or significant write-down of previously capitalized research and development costs and acquired technologies, Fulcrum said.</p>
<p>For the year, revenue is expected to total C$60 million, a 40 percent increase from the previous year.</p>
<p>Including the non-recurring charge the loss from operations is expected to be C$17 million, with an after-tax net loss for the year of C$11 million or $0.72 per share.</p>
<p>Eric Goodwin, Fulcrum's Chairman and CEO, stated: &quot;Although our revenue grew by approximately 40 percent this year, and we continue to gain overall market share, we are disappointed with our lower-than-expected results. We have seen some major contracts move out of the quarter and sales of our Fulcrum FIND! product have been significantly below expectations.&quot; The company announced appointment of Eric Goodwin, previously President and Chief Executive Officer, to Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and the appointment of Mike Laginski, previously Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, to President and Chief Operating Officer, effective immediately.</p>
