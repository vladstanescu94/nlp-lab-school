<p>U.S. stocks traded in London were mixed on Monday, and the Dow industrials were seen opening flat to slightly lower ahead of a slew of U.S. economic data due out later this week, dealers said.</p>
<p>At 1044 GMT, the September S&amp;P futures contract was down 0.65 point at 944.25 points on GLOBEX and the September T-bond contract was unchanged.</p>
<p>The Dow, which powered to record highs last week, closed 3.49 points lower on Friday at 8,113.44.</p>
<p>Shares in General Motors Corp rose 3/8 to $57-1/4, after the automotive maker and the United Auto Workers reached a tentative agreement on Friday night that ended a three-day strike that might have crippled GM's North American production within a week, dealers said.</p>
<p>Technology stocks were mixed.</p>
<p>Shares in Microsoft Corp slipped 1/4 to $138-1/4, after last week's cautious statements by the company about its future growth.</p>
<p>The Financial Times said on Monday that the U.S. software giant, which called Wall Street's valuation of the company as &quot;laughable&quot;, has embarked on a campaign to talk down its stock price.</p>
<p>Intel Corp stock fell to $88-3/4 in London from $89-3/16 in New York. Dealers blamed profit-taking and expectations that Intel would slash prices of the Pentium microprocessor by up to 50 percent on Sunday.</p>
<p>And shares in Dell Computer Corp rose slightly from its sharp sell-off on Friday, when the stock tumbled $7 to $163 after hitting a record high of $173-1/2.</p>
<p>The company previously announced a 2-for-1 stock split to be paid last Friday, which also made the shares look more attractive, one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very busy week economically, so people may stay on the sidelines for right now,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Top-tier U.S. economic data include second quarter employment cost index (ECI) on Tuesday, advanced second quarter reading on gross domestic product (GDP) on Thursday, and July payrolls and June personal income and consumption on Friday.</p>
<p>But Wall Street money market experts said they expected government bond prices to end the week unscathed, with the economy growing at a healthy pace without the threat of inflationary pressures.</p>
