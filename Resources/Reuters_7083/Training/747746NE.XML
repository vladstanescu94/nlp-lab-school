<p>Anti-piracy crusaders acting for the world's software giants claimed successes on Tuesday in a campaign against copyright thieves in Hong Kong, and said they would step up their fight.</p>
<p>The Business Software Alliance (BSA) said the campaign it launched three months ago had resulted in several successful legal actions against companies using illegal software in the workplace, with settlements totaling HK$3 million (US$387,600).</p>
<p>&quot;These actions should make companies in Hong Kong realise cheap pirated software is not a bargain and could end up costing them a million dollars,&quot; said BSA chairman Kevin Henshaw.</p>
<p>The BSA operates public education and enforcement programmes in 60 countries and represents the leading software publishers, including Microsoft, Novell, Adobe, Lotus Development, Autodesk, Symantec and the Santa Cruz Operation.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, a former British colony now part of China, has long been a trouble spot for intellectual property violations, and has been placed on a watchlist by the United States.</p>
<p>The territory is a prime market for software, computer games, compact disks, movies and other electronic products counterfeited in China.</p>
<p>Pirated copies of test versions of new software are often sold by Hong Kong bootleggers even before their makers launch them on the market.</p>
<p>The BSA said a recently enacted new copyright law in Hong Kong had given its anti-piracy campaign new teeth.</p>
<p>Since the launch of the campaign in April the BSA's hotline had received more than 200 tip-off calls, the BSA told a news conference. Tipsters are financially rewarded for information leading to successful prosecutions.</p>
<p>&quot;The fantastic response by members of the public sends a clear signal to users of illegal software -- it is only a matter of time before we're alerted to their activities,&quot; Henshaw said.</p>
<p>&quot;Already several companies have found to their cost that software theft is an expensive risk,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The biggest settlement against a company caught using illegal software here was a HK$1 million payment by a local television set maker, the BSA said.</p>
<p>The settlement cash against an abuser normally includes legal costs, damages and replacement software.</p>
<p>The BSA ploughs the money back into the campaign. It is confident of increasing the number of prosecutions.</p>
<p>&quot;We strongly recommend the new copyright laws which will allow us to take tougher, more wide-reaching action against offenders,&quot; Henshaw said.</p>
<p>Under the new law businesses which get involved in end-user piracy may be committing a criminal offence, may be prosecuted in court, and are more likely to receive a jail sentence or stiffer fines than previously.</p>
<p>The law provides for penalties of up to four years in jail and fines of HK$50,000 per software article.</p>
<p>The law beefs up the powers of customs and excise, allowing officers to enter premises by force if necessary, search and seize materials that they think infringe copyright, and to arrest suspects.</p>
