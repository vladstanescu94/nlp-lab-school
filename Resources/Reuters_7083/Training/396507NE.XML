<title>USA: Netscape starts cross-system Communicator beta.</title>
<headline>Netscape starts cross-system Communicator beta.</headline>
<dateline>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. 1997-02-23</dateline>

<p>Netscape Communications Corp. said Sunday it is posting a public preview release of its Communicator Internet software that will also work on Unix and Apple Computer Inc.'s Apple Macintosh.</p>
<p>In addition to the new beta version of Communicator, which is in keeping with the company's strategy of extending its software to run on a wide variety of computer systems, Netscape will also post the final beta test component of its SuiteSpot 3.0 family of products, executives said.</p>
<p>Communicator was initially released for Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 95 and Windows NT systems, and the new release of Communicator includes an update of the preview releases made available before Christmas.</p>
<p>Final versions of both Communicator and SuiteSpot 3.0 are expected to be introduced in the second quarter and the beta releases are expected to keep the company on track for its 1997 release schedule, analysts said.</p>
<p>Netscape is seeking to make the cross-platform support for its Communicator browser and electronic mail product a key differentiator between itself and Microsoft, which has charged into Internet software in the last six months.</p>
<p>Microsoft's release of beta versions of its Internet Explorer 3.0 for the Macintosh and even for its older Windows 3.1 software has lagged months behind those for its Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Redmond, Wash., company is expected to release test versions of its next generation of Internet browser software in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Netscape said its new Communicator releases include dynamic HTML, a version of the widely used Hyper Text Markup Language designed to move beyond static text and graphics to interactive Web pages and live business applications.</p>
<p>The desktop software is also designed to help Netscape pry its way into the market for electronic mail and groupware that was pioneered by Lotus Development Corp., now a unit of International Business Machines Corp.</p>
<p>Communicator includes the next version of Netscape's Navigator browser, along with HTML authoring, e-mail messaging, group discussion and collaboration software. A Professional edition includes calendaring and administration capabilities.</p>
<p>Netscape Communicator is expected to sell for $59 when it ships next quarter, but until April 1 customers can sign up for an upgrade by buying Netscape Navigator for $49 plus a one-year subscription for new client software releases for $17.</p>
<p>Netscape Communicator Professional Edition will be available at an expected price of $79.</p>
