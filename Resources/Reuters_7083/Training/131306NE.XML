<p>Wall Street stocks are expected to come in for some profit-taking at the opening after reaching for 6100 on Friday with most investors focusing on International Business Machines Corp earnings.</p>
<p>IBM reported third quarter net per share of $2.45, $0.02 above the the First Call estimate, and traded up 1/8 at 129-1/2 ahead of the opening.</p>
<p>But the stock had a strong run on Friday in anticipation of the earnings and analysts said they did not expect it to move sharply in trading today.  </p>
<p>But after an initial move to the upside, IBM sold off 1-5/8 to 127-3/4 in trading ahead of the opening bell.</p>
<p>A slide on better-than-forecast earnings is not uncommon in tech sector. For instance, Sun Microsystems Inc, fell last week after reporting earnings which were above Wall Street forecasts but below unofficial &quot;whisper&quot; estimates.</p>
<p>However, the sell-off in IBM may not be as bad. &quot;Some investors might be disappointed because IBM didn't have a blowout quarter,&quot; said Larry Wachtel, analyst at Prudential Securities. &quot;Not all disappointments are equal. IBM is very big and you won't get an explosion to the downside.&quot;  </p>
<p>Analysts said they expected to see some profit-taking at the opening after Friday's rally and double-witching expirations, with IBM weighing on the Dow.</p>
<p>&quot;I doubt there is anything dramatic about today,&quot; Wachtel said. &quot;I see some profit-taking after the double-witching on Friday and the futures are indicating a lower opening.&quot;</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 December futures contract was down 0.560 at 715.25.</p>
<p>Microsoft Corp is expected to report fiscal first quarter earnings after the close of trading today.  </p>
<p>Tokyo stocks ended lower, with the Nikkei Average down 309 points at 21,303.</p>
<p>In London, the FTSE 100 Index was up nine points at 4063.</p>
<p>Among U.S. shares traded in London, Microsoft shares were unchanged at 134-3/4 and Caterpillar Inc gained 1/4 to 74-3/8.</p>
<p>The dollar was near highs in Tokyo and at a new high against the yen in Europe.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries were flat, with the long bond unchanged to yield 6.80 percent.  </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street writes that Wall Street is awaiting a presentation to be made on Monday by IBM Corp's chief financial officer Richard Thoman about the company's performance.</p>
<p>The New York Times Market Place writes that U.S. Robotics Corp plans to launch a new modem have enticed traders on Wall Street. It said U.S. Robotics was the the industry leader, with about 40 percent of the consumer market and 50 percent of the commercial systems market.</p>
