<p>Borland International Inc will take a $24 to $30 million charge in its current fiscal 1997 fourth quarter to account for a restructuring plan announced earlier on Thursday, a company official said.</p>
<p>The restructuring charge will cover severance payments, expenses for closing the Boston office of its unit, Open Environment, and the relocation of developers to headquarters in Scotts Valley, Calif., Chief Financial Officer Paul Emery said during a teleconference with reporters.</p>
<p>Borland's plan is designed to trim staff to 700 employees from 1000 currently and cut expenses at the software company.  </p>
<p>When the program is complete, roughly 200 of its 700 employees will be in the product research and development sector, Chief Executive Officer Del Yocam said in the call.</p>
<p>The company hopes to cut as much as $30 million in operating expenses and another $30 million in new product expenses. Yocam said much of the product expense reduction comes from the closing of Open Environment in Boston.</p>
<p>He said the company will keep only some technical support staff in the Boston office.</p>
<p>Borland also will trim marketing expenses by shifting advertising from print and direct mail to the World Wide Web on the Internet, Yocam said.</p>
<p>The company's Website has proved highly successful in terms of customer contact and product support, he added.</p>
