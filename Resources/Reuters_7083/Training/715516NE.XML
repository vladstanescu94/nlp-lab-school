<title>USA: Silicon Valley execs launch public policy network.</title>
<headline>Silicon Valley execs launch public policy network.</headline>

<p>Two top Silicon Valley business leaders said Tuesday they have formed a network of high-tech executives and high-profile investors to battle for securities law reform and improved public education.</p>
<p>The new organization, dubbed the &quot;Technology Network,&quot; will target those two initiatives as its initial public policy agenda, but will also help the once politically docile high-tech sector wield increasing political clout in Washington.</p>
<p>Prominent venture capital investor John Doerr and Netscape Communications Corp CEO Jim Barksdale said they would serve as co-chairmen of the new organization, which will also help form state and federal political action committees to endorse and contribute to political candidates.</p>
<p>The organization springs in strong measure from last year's campaign, led by Doerr and other high tech executives, which raised $40 million to defeat California's Proposition 211, a ballot initiative that they said would have resulted in a flood of frivolous shareholder lawsuits.</p>
<p>The defeat of 211 has not prevented a flurry of new cases being brought in state courts nonetheless and TechNet, as its staff calls the new group, is backing federal legislation that would return most securities suits to federal courts.</p>
<p>Likewise, high-tech executives said their industry, founded on innovative thinking, needs higher education standards and greater collaboration between the industry and educators.</p>
<p>&quot;The biggest issue on the mind of the IT (information technology) professional is a shortage of people,&quot; who are qualified to work in the field, said Barksdale.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a great inhibitor to success.&quot;</p>
<p>Barksdale and Doerr told Reuters in an interview they intend to seek broad industry support for the new organization nationwide. In Silicon Valley they have already attracted top executives from companies like Cisco Systems, Intuit Corp and Sun Microsystems Inc..</p>
<p>Doerr said a random sampling he conducted of 20 companies which had succeeded in having securities litigation lawsuits dismissed found that companies had spent, on average, some $8 million apiece on those cases even though &quot;a judge or jury agreed they had no merit.&quot;</p>
<p>That amount is several times the fees charged by investment bankers to take a typical startup company public.</p>
<p>&quot;America's capital markets are a real national treasure. We need them to be efficient, whe need them to have high integrity and we don't need securities lawyers to be taking advantage of them,&quot; Doerr said.</p>
