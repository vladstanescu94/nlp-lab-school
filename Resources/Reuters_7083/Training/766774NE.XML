<headline>HOT STOCK HIGHLIGHTS - Q2 reports move stocks.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>AMERICAN GENERAL CORP		up 7/8 to 52-9/16</p>
<p>Stock hit a new 52-week high of 52-13/16 after posting earnings per share of $0.86, just a penny above estimates, compared to $0.77 last year.</p>
<p>    CLOROX CO			   up 3-5/8 to 138-1/4</p>
<p>Clorox shares jumped to a new high of 139 after it posted second quarter earnings of $1.44 a share, beating a forecast of $1.38, and said it expected strong profits in 1998, with its domestic business performing well. It also said it expected growth in international margins.  </p>
<p>    SYMANTEC CORP	     up 1-3/4 to 23-1/8</p>
<p>Symantec shares surged in heavy Nasdaq trading after the Cupertino, Calif. company posted record earnings for its fiscal first quarter ended July 4, 1997.  Earnings per share were $0.32 at the desktop software company, up over 400 percent versus the prior year first quarter. Shares moved as high as 23-3/8, a new 52-week high.</p>
<p>    ACT NETWORKS INC	  down 1-7/8 to 12-1/8</p>
<p>Stock falls more than ten percent. The company, which makes frame relay wide-area network access products, said fiscal fourth quarter revenues rose but earnings slipped to $0.01 from $0.09 a share last year.  </p>
<p>ACT said profits were hurt by a delay in the consolidation of its DynaStar acquisition and a slowdown in wireless orders from two big customers in Latin America, which meant a $2 million shortfall from the third quarter. ACT also said it still expects some &quot;lumpiness&quot; as those customers install and sell networks, but expects increasing revenues from the Latin American region in the first quarter of fiscal 1998.</p>
<p>    LAM RESEARCH CORP	     off 3-7/8 to 52-1/8</p>
<p>Shares fell in heavy trading after it posted a fiscal fourth quarter $0.06 loss, including a $0.15/share charge.  </p>
<p>Although the maker of semiconductor chip processing equipment said it believes the worst is behind it, Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock to a near-term neutral.</p>
<p>    SEACHANGE INTERNATIONAL INC   down 7-7/8 to 20</p>
<p>The company said late Tuesday second quarter earnings were $0.18, up from $0.12 last year, but the stock tumbled over 30 percent at times and two brokerages cut their rating on the stock. The company was not immediately available for comment.</p>
