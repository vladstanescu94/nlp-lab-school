<p>Some U.S. government computer systems failures are likely when the year 2000 begins, a congressional investigator warned on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there is a high probablity that there will be some failures,&quot; Joel Willemssen, the General Accounting Office's director of information resources management, told a House of Representatives Government Reform Committee hearing. The GAO is the congressional investigating agency.</p>
<p>He said the problem would occur when the date changes from Dec. 31, 1999 to Jan. 1, 2000. Many computers that only use the last two digits of a year will read the date as 1900.</p>
<p>&quot;Every government program that provides benefits in any way is subject to these problems, from Social Security and veterans' benefits to student loans and subsidized housing. This is not simply a government issue, it is something that will touch us all,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Willemssen said the problem could be corrected but would need major action by all departments and agencies because the government uses a wide variety of computer systems, many with computer languages that are old or obsolete.  &quot;It will take long, hard effort, but it can and must be done,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Keith Rhodes of the GAO said some problems were already happening. He said a three-year defense contract awarded last month for completion in January, 2000 caused a computer to issue a 97-year deliquency notice to the contractor.</p>
<p>Rep. Steve Horn, a California Republican, who chaired the hearing, said all federal agencies now realized there was a problem. &quot;The bad news is that only a few of them have specific, realistic plans to solve the problem before the stroke of midnight on the last day of 1999,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Emmett Paige, the Pentagon's chief information officer, said the Defense Department was moving aggressively to solve the problem at a cost of $1.1 billion. &quot;You can be confident that DOD will get the job done,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>John Callahan, assistant secretary of the Health and Human Services Department, which issues checks for Social Security and other programs, said the problem was serious but manageable. &quot;Year 2000 is a departmental priority,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Republican Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia said progress was being made, but expressed concern about a timetable released by the Office of Management and Budget for resolving the problem.</p>
<p>&quot;Many agencies will not be fully prepared, according to the report, until late 1999 and this leaves little time to correct a problem should anything go wrong,&quot; he said.</p>
