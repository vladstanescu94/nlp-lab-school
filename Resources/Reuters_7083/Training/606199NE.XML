<headline>INTERVIEW - Netscape lands big orders.</headline>

<p>Netscape Communications Corp has secured critical orders from more than 100 large customers since October, representing more than one million individual users, a senior executive said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mike Homer, Netscape's senior vice president of marketing, said the customer design &quot;wins,&quot; or orders, involve companies that have chosen its upcoming Communicator product and its SuiteSpot server products for either corporate messaging or business critical applications.</p>
<p>A win is Netscape's term for a sale to a customer who deploys the product to more than 500 individual users, or seats.</p>
<p>Separately, he said Netscape's Communicator Internet software will be released within 30 days.</p>
<p>&quot;The imperative is to ship the product as quickly as we possibly can. It has to be out right away,&quot; Homer told Reuters in an interview late Wednesday. &quot;We have a whole bunch (of customers) that are queued up until we ship the product.&quot;</p>
<p>Homer declined to say how many orders or customers had said they would commit once the product ships, however, and he said the 100 customers were a particular subset of total new business in the period. He declined to give total figures.</p>
<p>He also would not say whether the release of Communicator, now in a public beta test period, would be made prior to the company's developers conference in San Jose on June 11-12.</p>
<p>But he asserted its release will give Netscape a four- to five-month jump over the next release of rival Microsoft Corp.'s upcoming Internet Explorer 4.0 version.</p>
<p>&quot;Microsoft hasn't even gone into public beta yet,&quot; he said. Netscape posted a Communicator preview in December.</p>
<p>Brad Chase, vice president of Microsoft's applications and Internet clients group, said Wednesday the next version of Microsoft's browser would be available during the summer, but declined to give a specific time frame until feedback from an upcoming beta testing period can be evaluated.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now, summer is what we believe we'll make,&quot; he told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Previously, Netscape has said the final shipping version of its Netscape Communicator will be available by the end of the second quarter on June 30.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer will be free and shipped with Microsoft operating systems, while Netscape Communicator, which includes an array of added capabilities, will have a retail price of $59 and a professional edition, with more features, for $79.</p>
<p>Chrysler Corp, which is using Netscape products to build a dealer network, Prudential Healthcare, Scotia Capital Markets and Bay Networks are among the companies included by Netscape in its list of 100 critical customer wins.</p>
<p>Netscape said a more detailed list would be released on Thursday morning, with further descriptions of how customers are deploying its software in a variety of settings.</p>
<p>The U.S. Defense Logistics Agency, for example, has agreed to use the software to deploy applications on both its Intranet -- an internal network using Internet technology -- and Extranets, which run between different parties' networks.</p>
<p>Many of the customer design wins involve electronic mail systems, and Homer said this alone compares favourably with an International Data Corp industry forecast of 8.5 million e-mail seats to be sold in 1997.</p>
<p>Shares of Netscape have been volatile in the last week, tumbling roughly 15 percent last Friday after an analyst downgraded the stock to a &quot;short-term avoid&quot; and investors were rattled by fresh worries over a company statement in a regular federal filing that its historical growth rates will slow.</p>
<p>But several analysts said the sell-off was overdone, noting Netscape has provided cautious comments about its future financial performance in prior filings and the company is about to enter a strong phase of its new product cycle.</p>
