<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-10-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Salomon Brothers took a bet on shares of Computervision Corp Tuesday with an esoteric transaction called a jelly roll in some long-dated options, traders said.</p>
<p>The Computervision January 7-1/2 call traded 3,600 contracts by late trading and the corresponding put traded 2,975. The April 7-1/2 call traded 2,775 contracts and the April 7-1/2 put traded 2,750.</p>
<p>Computervision shares were unchanged at 8-3/4.</p>
<p>&quot;Salomon Brothers was getting long the jelly roll,&quot; said a trader on the Chicago Board Options Exchange.  </p>
<p>A &quot;jelly roll&quot; is a box-type strategy for rolling parts of a conversion or a synthetic stock position.</p>
<p>For example, an investor long stock, long puts and short calls who rolls out a short put and long call position would have done a jelly roll.</p>
<p>The recently published &quot;Dictionary of Financial Risk Management&quot; by Gary Castineau and Mark Kritzman defines jelly roll as a transaction that offsets long and short synthetic stock or stock index positions created from options with identical strikes but different expirations.  </p>
<p>The strategy is used to roll a synthetic stock position to a longer-dated expiration, it says.</p>
<p>In other trading, an investor did a buy-write in HBO &amp; Co, traders said.</p>
<p>The stock fell 4-1/8 to 54-1/2 on heavy volume. The February 60 call traded 3,260 contracts, most of it in a block that crossed at 4-1/2. The option, which had open interest of 235, closed at seven on Monday.</p>
<p>Also, options on several technology stocks were busy as investors reacted to a sharp selloff in the sector.  </p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite index, which is loaded with tech stocks, was down about 13 points, or one percent, at 1,203 in afternoon trade.</p>
<p>Technology stocks peppered the list of top net and percentage decliners.</p>
<p>In the group, Intel Corp fell 1-5/8 to 104-3/8, Microsoft Corp lost 1-1/4 to 135-3/8, Compaq Computer Corp was down 3-1/8 at 67-1/2 and International Business Machines Corp fell 1-3/4 to 125-5/8.</p>
<p>Options on Intel, Compaq and IBM were among the most active in the group.  </p>
<p>The IBM November 130 call, with open interest of 18,400, traded more than 4,400 contracts, making it among the most active around.</p>
<p>The IBM November 125 put, which had open interest of about 10,850, traded 3,350.</p>
<p>For Compaq, the most active option was the January 70 call, which traded roughly 4,000 contracts. The option, which had open interest of about 6,930, fell two to four.</p>
