<p>Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates said Tuesday that India had the potential to become a computer software superpower and promised help to New Delhi in building its vital communications infrastructure.</p>
<p>&quot;To be a leader in the digital economy of the 21st century, India must invest in basic infrastructure, education and information technology,&quot; Gates, who arrived on Monday on a four-day visit, said in a speech on information technology.</p>
<p>&quot;These are the tools which will drive the country into the future and make India an economic and software superpower.&quot;</p>
<p>Gates said he discussed India's need for an information infrastructure, especially in telecommunications, with Prime Minister H. D.Deve Gowda over breakfast on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Monday, he met with Finance Minister P. Chidambaram.</p>
<p>&quot;The key things they are talking about are opportunities for India and for investment,&quot; Gates told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Deve Gowda reiterated to the visitor his government's commitment to provide all the necessary fillip to the Indian scientific community to build on the existing strengths and advantages,&quot; the Indian government said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;In India there is opportunity to literally create hundreds of thousands of jobs,&quot; Gates said later at a business meeting.</p>
<p>Ninety percent of personal computers in the world run on operating software made by Microsoft. &quot;We are working with some experts to extend Windows to Hindi and other languages,&quot; Gates said.</p>
<p>India's software industry, which reported sales worth $1.2 billion in 1995/96 (April-March), expects to grow by 50 percent to $1.8 billion in the 1996/97 fiscal that ends this month.</p>
