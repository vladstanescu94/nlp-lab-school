<p>U.S. software giant Microsoft Corporation is planning to invest millions of dollars to expand its business in Africa, Microsoft managing director for Sub-Saharan Africa Rob Katz said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Katz said the corporation, which launched its South African office four years ago, was setting up an office in Zimbabwe and planned to establish offices in the Indian Ocean islands of Mauritius and Reunion within the next 24 months.</p>
<p>It opened offices early this year in Kenya and Ivory Coast which it planned to use as launchpads for expansion into eastern and western Africa respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking at other (African) countries where we can invest further,&quot; Katz told Reuters.</p>
<p>He, however, could not be drawn into saying how much the corporation was looking at investing on the world's poorest continent, just saying it ran into millions of dollars.</p>
<p>He said Microsoft, like other businesses, would invest in countries with some political stability and with viable business volumes.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't just rush in and put up an office in a country. We first develop business partners and grow them, invest in all the computerisation and links with our international network which is of great importance,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The other country I look at with great interest is Angola. If you look at the natural resources there and skills base we are right in the middle of the developing stages there,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Business is also beginning to bubble out of central Africa,&quot; he added, saying Microsoft was keeping an eye on that region.</p>
<p>Katz said Microsoft believed that information technology would fuel African economic growth into the 21st century, saying the continent only needed visionary political and business leaders to push that growth forward.</p>
<p>&quot;Africa is changing rapidly and for the better...the infrastructures are being improved to sustain these developments and Microsoft is in a position to drive this forward,&quot; he said, adding Africa needed leaders with a &quot;burning vision&quot; to boost economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe truly that by the year 2010 Africa could become the next South East Asia. The skills exist...(and) I believe that technology is a key enabler to achieving this.&quot;</p>
<p>Early this year during a visit to South Africa, Microsoft chief executive and computer guru Bill Gates said Africa's image as technologically backward was unfounded and that the Internet would open up the continent to the world. ---Harare newsroom: +263-4 72 52 27/8/9</p>
