<p>Shares of new issues got a warm reception on Wall Street on Wednesday, with five new offerings all reaping solid gains at their market debuts.</p>
<p>Companies going public today in U.S. markets:</p>
<p>-- Corsair Communications Inc jumped over 30 percent, gaining 4-3/4 to 19-3/4 after its $37.5 million initial public offering.</p>
<p>The Palo Alto, Calif., company sold 2.5 million shares for $15 each, above its range of $14 to $15. It makes a system that delivers multiple products and services to the wireless phone industry.  </p>
<p>-- Vestcom International Inc also rose, adding 21 percent, up 2-3/4 to 15-3/4.  Shares were priced at $13, the top of a range of $11 to $13.  The Lyndhurst, N.J. company provides computer output and document management services.</p>
<p>Oppenheimer was the lead underwriter of the 3.85 million share offering, which raised roughly $50 million.  Nearly 2.5 million shares had changed hands in late trading.</p>
<p>-- Information Management Associates Inc had textbook IPO gains of about 11 percent, with the stock up 1-1/2 to 14-1/2.  A total of 3.9 million shares were sold, with 2.8 million by the company.  </p>
