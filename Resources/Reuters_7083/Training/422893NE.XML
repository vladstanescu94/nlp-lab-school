<title>USA: U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Big WorldCom call position sold.</title>
<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Big WorldCom call position sold.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-03-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>An institutional investor sold a big position in the WorldCom Inc April 25 calls for a customer, with the firm and market makers buying them up, traders said Thursday.</p>
<p>In late trading, WorldCom was down 1-1/16 at 23-13/16 on more than 9.9 million shares.</p>
<p>The WorldCom April 25 call traded a total of 11,636 contracts, the bulk of it coming in two blocks, one of 5,000 contracts and one of 6,000.</p>
<p>The blocks went off at 1-3/16 and 1-1/8. Through Wednesday, the option had open interest of 388 contracts.  </p>
<p>&quot;There were two orders and a customer sold both,&quot; one options trader said. &quot;The firm and market makers were the buyers.&quot;</p>
<p>He said there were also fairly heavy sellers of the March 22-1/2 puts and the April 22-1/2 and 25 puts.</p>
<p>Those three contracts traded 1,610, 2,135 and 1,395 contracts, respectively.</p>
<p>Traders said there was little news out on the stock except for a credit rating assignment and confirmation from Moody's Investors Service which they said had little impact on the stock or the options.  </p>
<p>WorldCom shares have slid since their close at 27-1/2 on February 27, when the company reported fourth quarter 1996 earnings that beat analysts' consensus estimates.</p>
<p>The shares fell to 23-3/4 Thursday before recovering.</p>
<p>Options traders said that despite the solid earnings, concern was growing that the company might have to restate some earnings to reflect its merger with MFS Communications, which was completed at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>A WorldCom spokesman said he was not aware of any plans to restate earnings.  </p>
<p>&quot;Some guys on the Street are thinking they're going to have to rewrite some (earnings) to integrate MFS,&quot; one options trader said.</p>
<p>In other trading, options on shares of Oracle Corp were active as the stock led a broad technology sector lower.</p>
<p>Traders said most of the options activity was mixed.</p>
<p>&quot;We were out there selling some calls against stock,&quot; one trader said, citing the March 35 and March 40 calls, specifically. Those two options traded about 5,200 and 6,485 contracts, respectively.  </p>
<p>Oracle shares lost 3-3/16 to 36-9/16 on heavy turnover of nearly 19 million shares.</p>
<p>&quot;All the techs are getting whacked pretty good,&quot; one options trader said. &quot;Oracle happens to be the one they're concentrating on.&quot; ((--G.Crawford, 312 408 8750/Email: derivatives@reuters.com))</p>
