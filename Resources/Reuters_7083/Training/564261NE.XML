<title>GERMANY: German investors lobby for insider deals action.</title>
<headline>German investors lobby for insider deals action.</headline>

<p>A German shareholder protection lobby group on Tuesday urged tougher action against insider trading following news of an investigation into alleged insider dealing in shares of software firm SAP AG.</p>
<p>Anneliese Hieke, spokeswoman for the Association for the Protection of Small Shareholders, told German radio that personnel at Germany's stock market watchdog, the BAWe authority, should be increased &quot;at least tenfold.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tough action must be taken,&quot; Hieke said, arguing that small shareholders suffered the most when insider deals went through undetected.</p>
<p>The BAWe was established in 1995 to implement a 1994 law which banned insider trading in Germany for the first time.</p>
<p>The SAP case has been its most high-profile to date. Prosecutors tipped off by the BAWe said on Monday they were starting an extensive probe, which the BAWe says targets 100 employees and associates of the software firm.</p>
<p>SAP has stood by its staff, saying it had no reason to suspect them of misusing inside information and has also said it is co-operating fully with investigators.</p>
<p>After a slow start, the BAWe now has some 100 staff and an electronic monitoring system which allows it to assess 400,000 trades taking place in Germany daily.</p>
<p>The Frankfurt-based agency passed on 11 cases of suspected insider trading to prosecutors in the first quarter of 1997, compared with seven for the whole of 1995.</p>
<p>The maxixum penalty for insider trading in Germany is a five year jail term but no custodial sentence has yet been imposed.</p>
<p>The highest fine, imposed earlier this year, totalled 3.6 million marks, with one million marks to be paid up front while the rest is suspended pending a probationary period.</p>
