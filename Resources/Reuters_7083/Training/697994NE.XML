<headline>Cambridge sees loss for June Q and year.</headline>

<p>Cambridge SoundWorks Inc said Tuesday it expected to report a loss for the quarter and its fiscal year ended June 29.</p>
<p>A April 29 First Call estimate of one broker put the company's quarterly earnings at a loss of $0.05 per share, but projected it to post a profit of $0.08 for the year.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're 15 cents (a share) positive for three quarters. So if we say we expect a loss for the year, it's more than 15 cent (loss per share for the June quarter),&quot; said Wayne Garrett, Cambridge's vice president of finance. He added he could not yet estimate the exact dollar amount of the loss.</p>
<p>Garrett attributed the quarterly loss to slow orders from the company's largest wholesale customer Best Buy Co Inc and a $4.5 million order backlog from Creative Technology Ltd, the company's major new wholesale customer and multimedia industry partner.  </p>
<p>He added Creative took a 20 percent stake (on a fully-diluted basis) in Cambridge in February plus warrants to buy an additional five percent of the company.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a transition here; away from Best Buy and a start-up with Creative,&quot; Garrett said, adding the June quarter historically has been the company's weakest quarter.</p>
<p>The company also said expenses relating to its new productions in Asia contributed to the loss.  </p>
<p>The stereo manufacturer said wholesale sales plummeted 77 percent while retail sales were up 35 percent for the June quarter compared with the same period last year. It added overall sales were down 15 percent in the same period.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Cambridge said it expected to post record sales for the fiscal year ended June 29.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll have substantially more (in revenues) this year than the $43.5 million (the company posted) in fiscal 1996,&quot; Garrett said.</p>
<p>Cambridge's stock traded at 4-1/2 Tuesday afternoon, down 1/2.</p>
