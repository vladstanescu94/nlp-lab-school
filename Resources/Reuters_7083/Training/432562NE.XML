<p>Polish computer maker Optimus SA and Microsoft Corp. signed on Tuesday an agreement to market and sell under a joint brand a new computer equipped with Microsoft business software.</p>
<p>Optimus president Roman Kluska told a news conference after the signing ceremony the new product called Microsoft Business PC-OPTIMUS&quot; would be launched on the Polish market by the end of this week.</p>
<p>He said that under the agreement Optimus would supply the hardware and its distribution network while Microsoft would bring in its 32-bit software applications, accessories and marketing support.</p>
<p>He said the new product would come with extensive technical and service support and would have full network ability.</p>
<p>Waldemar Sielski, the head of Microsoft's Polish subsidiary, also present, said such an agreement was Microsoft's third ever and the first of its kind in Europe.</p>
<p>The officials did not give any financial details of the deal and Kluska declined to say how the agreement would affect Optimus' earnings. He said however the deal would likely add significantly to the company's sales.</p>
<p>&quot;This will become a significant part of our sales in 1997 because on the Polish market demand from business is the highest and we estimate demand for such computers at 400,000-1,000,000 million units annually,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kluska said that at least initially the new computers would be sold only in Poland.</p>
