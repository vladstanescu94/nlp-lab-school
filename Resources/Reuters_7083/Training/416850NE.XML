<headline>SystemSoft drops amid downgrade, EPS view cut.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares of SystemSoft Corp dropped sharply after a Hambrecht &amp; Quist analyst downgraded the stock and lowered earnings estimates.</p>
<p>Hambrecht &amp; Quist analyst Todd Bakar cut his rating on SystemSoft to buy from strong buy and trimmed his 1998 revenue and earnings estimate to $73 million and $0.50 a share from $0.90 million and $0.65 a share.  In a research report, Bakar said he cut the 1998 estimates due to uncertainty relating to the recognition of SystemWizard royalty payments as well as some near-term integration issues as SystemSoft installs SystemWizard servers and trains vendor support staff.  </p>
<p>Bakar said Packard Bell NEC Inc has not yet started shipping personal computers, which incorporate SystemWizard. Also, U.S. Robotics Corp is expected to ship its Sportster modem line, bundled with SystemWizard, at the end of the first quarter. These SystemWizard shipping delays will dampen 1998 revenues, Bakar said.</p>
<p>Despite the cut in the 1998 earnings view, Bakar expects SystemSoft to post &quot;accelerating revenue momentum&quot; in each quarter of 1998.  </p>
<p>SystemSoft's core personal computer card software busines should grow about 25 to 30 percent in 1998.  On a long-term basis, SystemSoft's prospects appear solid, Bakar said.</p>
<p>Bakar, one of the few analysts that track the stock, said he expects SystemSoft's shares to remain in a narrow trading range in the mid-teens over the next several months. SystemSoft lost 4-3/8 to 12-5/8 in afternoon trading.</p>
<p>After the market closed Monday, SystemSoft posted fourth quarter earnings from operations of $0.08 a share on revenues of $12 million, compared with $0.05 a share on revenues of $7.3 million. SystemSoft's earnings from operations exclude $46.5 million in acquisition-related charges.</p>
<p>On a consensus basis, analysts expected the company to earn $0.08 a share, according to First Call.</p>
