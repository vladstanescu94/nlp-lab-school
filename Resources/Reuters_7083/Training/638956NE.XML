<headline>Sun says U.S. group votes down Java plan.</headline>
<dateline>PALO ALTO, Calif. 1997-06-05</dateline>

<p>Sun Microsystems Inc's JavaSoft group said a U.S. joint technical committee had Thursday voted &quot;no, with comments,&quot; to a plan to designate Sun as a group that can submit Java technology as a global standard.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for JavaSoft said the vote, taken at a meeting of the joint committee in Virginia, would forward the U.S. vote to an international decision-making group where it will be tallied with the votes of 26 other countries.  </p>
<p>Details of the comments attached to the negative vote were not immediately available, she said, but Sun will respond to these comments before final votes are tallied.</p>
<p>Java is programming language introduced by Sun two years ago which enables software to run on incompatible computers.</p>
<p>The plan, proposed three months ago by Sun, would have enabled Sun's JavaSoft unit to take the unusual step as a private company of becoming the official body designated to submit technical details of its Java programming language directly to international standards bodies for approval.  </p>
<p>Sun has said its proposal would speed the standards process, but powerful critics of the plan, including industry heavyweights Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp, have objected to giving this role to one company.  </p>
<p>But Microsoft and Intel are relatively new members of the technical group and have not yet received voting rights.</p>
<p>The issue has been sufficiently contentious that an ad hoc review committee of the U.S. group could not reach consensus on a recommended position for endorsement by the full group, which joins the International Standards Organization and the International Electrotechnical Commission.</p>
<p>But executives familiar with standards setting procedures said a negative vote with comments still gives Sun hope that it will be able to respond to the comments favorably.</p>
<p>The most controversial aspect of the proposal was to make Sun a formal standards body which could effectively set the path of defining Java as a standard. Sun argues it has set up its JavaSoft unit to achieve broad industry support from its major licensees, which include the world's top computer firms.</p>
<p>Jim Mitchell, vice president for technology and architecture at Sun's JavaSoft unit, said, &quot;From what I know of the comments, they're primarily in my view requests for clarification.&quot;</p>
<p>They include three issues -- the degree to which Sun plans to enforce its trademarking of the Java name, how it intends to evolve and maintain the standard and what precise technologies Sun expects to submit to the international standards group.</p>
<p>These are all issues which Sun has anticipated, and is prepared to address, Mitchell said.</p>
<p>All the countries are due to vote before mid-July, according to a spokeswoman for the standards organizations.</p>
