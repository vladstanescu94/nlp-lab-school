<headline>RESEARCH ALERT - Needham reiterates Citrix.</headline>
<text>
<p>-- Needham &amp; Co analyst Mike Cristinziano said he reiterrated his strong buy rating on Citrix Systems Inc and described a sell-off that occurred Thursday as &quot;irrational.&quot;</p>
<p>-- The analyst said the company was the victim of a variety of market rumors, resurfaced old news and a negative write-up in a technical analysis newsletter. &quot;Most of it was rumor or unwarranted concern,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>-- Citrix makes remote access software that allows a variety of computer systems and electronic appliances to run Microsoft Corp Windows applications without having the entire Windows operating system present on their machines.  </p>
<p>-- Thursday, the stock had given back more than 10 points to fall to 29-1/8, amidst a generally weak day for tech stocks, but rebounded some in early trading Friday morning, gaining 3-3/8 to 32-1/2.</p>
<p>-- Specifically, he said that concerns about the company's close relationship to Microsoft and Microsoft's future product plans were unwarranted.</p>
<p>-- &quot;The most significant rumor that is absolutely unture is that Microsoft cancelled its agreement to license Windows NT to Citrix,&quot; Cristinziano said.  </p>
<p>-- Compounding this were resurfaced concerns that Intel Corp and Microsoft's &quot;zero administration PC&quot; effort, introduced in fourth quarter 1996, would kill Citrix's plans to sell Windows-based software for network computers.</p>
<p>-- The analyst allowed that he has not been able to verify a rumor that Microsoft may be planning to integrate multi-user access features into the next major release of Window NT (5.0) that would eliminate the need for a key Citrix technology.</p>
<p>-- However, he dismissed the idea Microsoft would make introduction of multi-user access a priority within the next two years, given that Citrix already offers the features and that Microsoft benefits from Citrix's success, since Microsoft holds a six percent stake in Citrix.</p>
<p>-- &quot;This is a company that is going to grow over 100 percent over the next two years,&quot; he said, adding that at 35 times his 1997 estimate of $87.5 million in revenues and $0.83 in earnings per share, &quot;the stock is damn cheap.&quot;</p>
