<p>Premenos Technology Corp Wednesday said it expects to report losses in the current quarter and the subsequent quarter.</p>
<p>In a statement, the provider of electronic commerce solutions said it expects to post a loss in the first quarter ending in March of between $0.04 and $0.07 a share. Premenos did not specify a range for the second quarter.</p>
<p>According to First Call, analysts had expected the company to report a profit of $0.01 a share in the first quarter and $0.04 a share in the second quarter, up from $0.02 and $0.05 a share respectively a year ago.  </p>
<p>Premenos said the loss reflects a review of the company's operations and sales and marketing strategy undertaken by new President and Chief Executie Timothy Dreisbach, who joined the company in January.</p>
<p>&quot;The company's core business is solid, and we are very confident about our expanded product suite and emerging market demand,&quot; Dreisbach said. &quot;However, management's plan for positive operating margins on an annual basis will not be achieved in the early quarters of this fiscal year.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Since I arrived two months ago, the company has begun to refine its market strategy, with an increased emphasis on multi-product synergies, corresponding realignments of our marketing and sales channels and recasting of the executive management team,&quot; he said. &quot;We are also absorbing significant headcount growth that occurred in the fourth quarter of 1996.&quot;</p>
<p>The company said its board of directors also approved the purchase of up to one million shares of common stock from time to time in the open market.</p>
<p>The company had 11,679,314 shares of common stock outstanding as of March 3.</p>
<p>Premenos fell 1-/2 to 5-7/8 on Nasdaq.</p>
