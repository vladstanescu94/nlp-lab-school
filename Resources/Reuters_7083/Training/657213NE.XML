<p>Intuit Inc. said Wednesday it agreed to pay $40 million for a 19 percent stake in Internet search site operator Excite Inc.</p>
<p>The companies also entered a seven-year agreement to develop sites on the Internet's World Wide Web where customers can manage their finances. Both companies see financial services on the Web as a potentially big source of additional revenue.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Intuit will buy 2.9 million shares of Excite at $13.50 a share.</p>
<p>The companies announced the agreement after the market closed, but Excite's stock had jumped $2.25, or 17 percent, to close at $15.375 on Nasdaq. Intuit closed down 50 cents at $24.50.</p>
<p>&quot;We see the financial services and transaction parts of the Web as key areas of growth,&quot; said George Bell, Excite's chief executive.</p>
<p>Intuit's investment also shores up Excite's balance sheet, Bell said. Excite had planned to raise money by selling an additional 2.3 million shares in a secondary stock offering, but the agreement with Intuit will take the offering's place.</p>
<p>Intuit is best known for Quicken, the best-selling electronic personal finance program. In the past year, however, the Mountain View, Calif.-based company has been concentrating on selling financial services -- such as insurance policies -- through the Internet to wean itself from its flagging software business.</p>
<p>Through its Web site, Intuit connects customers to financial institutions. It makes money by charging a commission on each sale.</p>
<p>Excite, based in Redwood City, Calif., operates Web sites that help Internet surfers find documents or other sites of interest. Its flagship search site is consistently one of the most popular sites on the Internet.</p>
<p>This summer, Intuit and Excite will introduce a financial site with news, stock quotes and financial directories, the companies said. They expect to make money from advertising on the site and fees for a cut of financial services sold.</p>
<p>&quot;For consumers this will be the best place to make financial decisions,&quot; said Scott Cook, Intuit chairman. &quot;For financial institutions, this will be the best place to sell to people.&quot;</p>
<p>The partnership could help both companies speed up the development of profitable sites, analysts said. Both companies could use new sources of revenue.</p>
<p>&quot;For Intuit, Quicken is declining on a dollar basis,&quot; said Mike Wallace, analyst at investment bank UBS Securities in New York. &quot;They've got to accelerate their move to the Internet.&quot;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Intuit said it would fire 270 workers, or 10 percent of its workforce, to save money. The company has been telling investors to expect slowing revenue growth.</p>
<p>Excite, which competes with companies like Yahoo! Inc., had a net loss of $43.1 million, or $3.65 a share, on revenue of $14.8 million in 1996.</p>
<p>America Online Inc. also owns a 19 percent stake in Excite.</p>
