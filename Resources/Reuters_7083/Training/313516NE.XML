<p>By Russell Blinch</p>
<p>Corel Corp., Canada's largest software company, Wednesday announced a return to profitability in the fourth quarter and predicted further gains as it continued to battle with Microsoft Corp..</p>
<p>Corel reported a profit of $6.5 million, or 9 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30, against a year-ago loss of $956,000, or 2 cents per share.</p>
<p>Corel, which closed unchanged at C$10.70 ($7.99) on the Toronto Stock Exchange, said sales soared 102 percent to $125.4 million from $62.1 million in 1995's fourth quarter.</p>
<p>For the year, however, Corel reported a loss of $2.75 million, or 4 cents per share, after a 1995 profit of $14.4 million, or 26 cents per share.</p>
<p>&quot;Although earnings per share are down for the year as a whole, the strong fourth-quarter sales -- an incredible gain from the same quarter in 1995 -- point to a banner year in 1997,&quot; Corel Chief Executive Michael Cowpland said in a statement.</p>
<p>Cowpland told a conference call with analysts and reporters that the company was expecting sales growth of 30 percent to 40 percent this year with the aim of being profitable in all four quarters.</p>
<p>Corel, previously known for its CorelDRAW graphics programs, bought the WordPerfect software company last year and has been going head to head against Microsoft's Word program for market share in the lucrative office software market.</p>
<p>Corel officials said the company sold some 2.9 million units of WordPerfect in the year, which accounted for about 36 percent of its total sales.</p>
<p>Cowpland said the company was pleased it has maintained a market share of about 40 percent in the market for word processing software despite the publicity surrounding Microsoft's release of its Office 97 product this week.</p>
<p>He said that by introducing hot new Java software with the WordPerfect line, Corel has shown it can compete with the world's largest software company.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though Microsoft is larger, we can move faster,&quot; Cowpland said.</p>
<p>Corel derived about a third of its WordPerfect revenues from the corporate market, according to Cowpland. He said the company would soon announce a number of deals where personal computer makers will bundle WordPerfect with new PC shipments.</p>
<p>Cowpland acknowledged sales in the home software market were reaching &quot;saturation.&quot; But he said the company was releasing nine new titles which he hoped would spark sales in the segment.</p>
