<p>The Internet browser wars are heating up again with Microsoft expected to post the latest test version of its Internet Explorer on Tuesday and announce support from some 250 content providers.</p>
<p>Microsoft executives said the so-called Preview 2 of Internet Explorer version 4.0 will be widely available on Tuesday for free download, with computer professionals and enthusiasts the target audience.</p>
<p>Kevin Unangst, a Microsoft product manager, said the new version was &quot;much more stable&quot; and complete than a previous test version targeted at developers, although he cautioned that like all beta software the new browser still has bugs.</p>
<p>He said the software giant was on schedule for final release of the browser by the end of summer for Windows 95 and Windows NT and no more than 60 days later for the older Windows 3.1 platform and Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh system.</p>
<p>The software release already has reignited the war of words between Microsoft and archrival Netscape Communications Corp., which released the latest version of its own Communicator 4.0 browser last month.</p>
<p>&quot;They've fallen months behind us,&quot; said Mike Homer, Netscape's senior vice president of marketing, who predicted it would take Microsoft five months rather than two to complete user testing of its new browser.</p>
<p>He also said the new version of Explorer would not be complete until Microsoft delivers the &quot;Memphis&quot; version of its Windows 95 operating system, expected early next year.</p>
<p>The new version of Internet Explorer adds several key features including the ability to &quot;browse&quot; for documents on a hard drive, internal company network or the Internet using a single interface.</p>
<p>The integrated interface also will be a key feature of Memphis, but Microsoft's Unangst said the new version of Internet Explorer will include an option allowing users to integrate the browser functions with the Windows 95 start button.</p>
<p>&quot;Users have told us over and over, 'It sure would be great if I had a consistent way of accessing information,'&quot; Unangst said.</p>
<p>The new browser also adopts the concept of &quot;channels&quot; allowing users to easily get content provided by companies such as Walt Disney Co., The New York Times, MTV and ESPN SportZone.</p>
<p>Customized news and information updates can be delivered to the user's desktop on a regularly scheduled basis.</p>
<p>Jesse Berst, a Microsoft analyst and editorial director of ZDNet's AnchorDesk, said Microsoft's focus on integrating content into the browser advances the product ahead of what Netscape's Communicator offers.</p>
<p>Despite the aggressive competition from Microsoft, which essentially declared war on Netscape in December 1995, Netscape's share of the browser market has slipped only to about 70 percent from 80 percent two years ago.</p>
<p>Netscape has redesigned its product line to shift attention from the browser wars and focus on large enterprise users, and Homer said its new suites have been purchased by more than 200 major companies representing more than 2 million seats.</p>
<p>But Berst said the browser market is critical to Netscape's effort to break Microsoft's dominance of the personal computer industry and the software development community.</p>
<p>&quot;Were they in fact to lose the browser war they would disappear from the average user's mind,&quot; Berst said. &quot;They know that, and they are watching their market share very carefully.&quot;</p>
