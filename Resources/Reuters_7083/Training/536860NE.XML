<p>PeopleSoft Inc. stock soared Wednesday after the personnel management software publisher reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and told investors to expect its revenues to rise 70 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>Stock in Pleasanton, Calif.-based PeopleSoft rose $6.625 to $41.75 on Nasdaq trading of 4.4 million shares. Earlier, the shares traded as high as $42, a 20 percent gain.</p>
<p>PeopleSoft, which writes software to help big companies keep track of financial and human resources records, said Tuesday its first-quarter net income almost doubled to $17.8 million, or 14 cents a share, as revenues rose 87 percent to $154.7 million.</p>
<p>Wall Street expected PeopleSoft to earn 12 cents a share, according to a recent analyst survey by Zacks Investment Research.</p>
<p>The company also said it expects revenue for the year to rise 70 percent, also better than Wall Street had forecast.</p>
<p>At least three investment banks raised their stock rating on PeopleSoft to &quot;buy,&quot; based on PeopleSoft's outlook for the year.</p>
<p>PeopleSoft said demand for software to manage vital corporate information is growing as companies store more of their data in computer networks.</p>
<p>The company also plans to release new versions of key products -- featuring more flexible configurations and easier access to data -- in September.</p>
<p>PeopleSoft Chief Financial Officer Ron Codd said the new products could help the company beef up its technology image against rivals SAP AG and Oracle Corp.</p>
