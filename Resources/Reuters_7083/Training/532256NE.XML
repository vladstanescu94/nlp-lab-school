<p>Netscape Communications Corp. on Wednesday reported a 119 percent surge in first-quarter profits to $7.9 million at the Internet software company.</p>
<p>The Mountain View, Calif.-based company's commentary on its results was characteristically sparse, but in a statement Chief Executive Officer Jim Barksdale said the company's server -- or network host computer software -- business continued to grow.</p>
<p>Netscape's earnings, equal to 9 cents a share, compared with $3.6 million, or 4 cents a share in the first quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Revenues totalled $120.2 million, a 114 percent increase over the $56.1 million in revenues generated a year ago. Industry analysts on average had expected Netscape to post earnings of 8 cents a share.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people did not expect it to match estimates,&quot; said one analyst immediately after the figures were released, noting the stock had traded near the low end of its 52-week trading range in recent days.</p>
<p>The earnings were released after the market close.</p>
<p>Netscape shares had traded at less than a third of their 52-week intraday peak of $75.25 during Wednesday's session, but rallied to close up $2.50 at $27.50 in Nasdaq trade.</p>
<p>The stock remained steady in after-hours trade, trading in a band of $27.375 to $27.625.</p>
<p>With little news accompanying the earnings statement, analysts said much of the stock's performance in the next session will depend on what executives said in conference calls with analysts and reporters later Wednesday.</p>
