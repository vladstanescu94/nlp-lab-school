<p>Microsoft Corp. faces a year of slowing growth as it beefs up efforts to market its high-end systems to businesses, but company executives and analysts remain optimistic about the computer software giant's long-term outlook.  </p>
<p>At a day-long briefing in Seattle on Thursday before 300 financial analysts and reporters, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and other top executives gave traditionally cautious comments about the year to come, citing the possibility that personal computer sales growth will slow or that the rival network computer platform will catch fire.  </p>
<p>&quot;Our focus remains the same,&quot; Gates said. &quot;Our ... gravity is being a software company, although we're willing to mix content in.&quot;</p>
<p>But for the coming year the focus will be on investment, particularly in new consultants and engineers to drive sales into large organizations and &quot;evangelize&quot; independent developers to create new Windows-based applications.  </p>
<p>Executives said they did not expect the forthcoming Windows 98 operating system, due out in the first quarter of 1998, to come close to matching the performance of Windows 95, which has driven a wave of upgrades and increased revenues since its release two years ago.</p>
<p>But because of the muted expectations for the upgrade, previously code-named Memphis, analysts said its release could drive earnings beyond expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Memphis is really the key variable for the second half of the year that could help,&quot; said Rick Sherlund of Goldman Sachs.  </p>
<p>Gates and other executives took special relish in attacking Microsoft rivals Sun Microsystems Inc. and Oracle Corp., chief proponents of the network computer, an alternative to Microsoft's operating system.</p>
<p>Executive Vice President Steve Ballmer said Microsoft was looking carefully to see where it could take business from Sun, mainly because of relentless its anti-Microsoft rhetoric and what executives called an effort by Sun to establish a Java-based &quot;middleware operating system&quot; to run on top of Windows.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's a bit of an upside potential here,&quot; Ballmer said. &quot;It's not huge, but Sun's focus on that middleware operating system has certainly galvanized us on this opportunity.&quot;</p>
<p>And even as Microsoft is promoting the NetPC computer and Windows-based &quot;dumb&quot; terminals to defend against the network computer promoted by Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison, Gates ridiculed the emerging platform, saying NC appears to mean &quot;not compatible.&quot;  </p>
<p>Although Microsoft's stock fell Thursday on concerns about higher spending levels, analysts said executives revealed little new information at the Thursday briefing and long have signaled the likely slowdown, most recently when fourth-quarter earnings were released last week.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they went through the motions,&quot; said Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie, a Seattle-based brokerage. &quot;I don't think people will be changing their numbers coming out of this meeting.&quot;</p>
<p>On average, analysts expect Microsoft to earn $3.17 a share in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1998, up from $2.63 in the year just ended.</p>
<p>McAdams said Microsoft likely would beat the number based on upgrades to Windows 98 and increasing sales of Windows NT.</p>
<p>He also said prospects were good for fiscal 1999, when many analysts expect a new version of Office which takes advantage of Microsoft's heavy research into natural language processing.</p>
