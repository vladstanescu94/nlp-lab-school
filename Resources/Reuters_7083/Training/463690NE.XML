<p>Anglo-Dutch publishing group Reed-Elsevier, seeking to expand its highly profitable scientific publishing business, said Monday it agreed to buy MDL Information Systems Inc. of California for $320 million.</p>
<p>Reed-Elsevier, which is launching an online electronic data delivery service for scientific journals this summer, said its Elsevier Science Inc. unit would offer about $32 a share for all outstanding shares in MDL -- a hefty premium over the stock's closing price Friday.</p>
<p>The planned acquisition will bring together the leading provider of scientific information with the leading provider of systems to manage and analyse such data, the company said.</p>
<p>MDL's stock soared on the news, jumping by $14 to $31.25 in early afternoon trading on the Nasdaq market, where it was one of the most actively traded issues.</p>
<p>&quot;I think $32 is the value to us for the company, and for others as well,&quot; Reed-Elsevier executive committee member Paul Vlek said in a telephone interview. &quot;This price is on the table after a lot of negotiation. Half a year ago the share price was $33. We think the company is worth it.&quot;</p>
<p>Vlek said Reed-Elsevier saw significant synergies in the acquisition of MDL, which would help it in its strategy of increasing its activities in electronic publishing.</p>
<p>Elsevier Science publishes more than 1,200 scientific journals and plans to start delivering them through an online database this year under the name of Science Direct.</p>
<p>MDL, which is based in San Leandro, Calif., provides software systems, databases and related services that help companies in the chemical, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries manage, analyse and communicate high volumes of research material.</p>
<p>In February it signed a deal worth several million dollars over three years to supply software and services to Glaxo Wellcome Plc of Britain, the world's biggest pharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>&quot;There are definitely advantages ...,&quot; Vlek said. &quot;We can use their information and systems to sell to our client base. We can use their client base, the pharmaceutical industries in the first place, to sell our information.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a content provider, they are a service provider and we are gaining a lot of experience in combining the two.&quot;</p>
<p>Reed-Elsevier is the world's biggest scientific publisher and science publishing is its most profitable business, with an operating profit margin of 41.8 percent last year.</p>
<p>Vlek said the acquisition of MDL would not have any immediate impact on Reed-Elsevier's earnings, but it was expected to add to profits by next year.</p>
<p>&quot;Starting from 1998 earnings will be enhanced by the acquisition,&quot; Vlek said.</p>
<p>Reed Elsevier had revenues of 3.38 billion British pounds ($5.4 billion) in 1996, of which 553 million ($888 million) came from science publishing.</p>
<p>Vlek also said he expected the deal, which requires U.S. regulatory approval, to be completed towards the end of June.</p>
<p>European analysts praised the proposed acquisition.</p>
<p>&quot;MDL looks like a good fit,&quot; Patrick Wollenberg of Rabo Securities said.  &quot;In terms of multiples of sales and profits the (price) is pretty substantial ... but I think the synergy advantages will justify that. For strategic acquisitions it's worth paying high multiples.&quot;</p>
<p>MDL posted net income of $12.4 million on revenues of $62 million in the year ended March 31, 1996.</p>
