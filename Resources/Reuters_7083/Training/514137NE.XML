<headline>Clarify plunges on 2nd-quarter outlook.</headline>
<dateline>SAN JOSE, Calif. 1997-04-16</dateline>

<p>Clarify Inc shares lost over half of their value Tuesday after the help-desk software developer said it expects little, if any, revenue growth in the second quarter over the first.</p>
<p>Shares of Clarify, based in San Jose, Calif., were down 9-5/8 at 7-1/8 on trading of 6.41 million shares, making the stock the second-most active in U.S. markets. Earlier, the shares traded as low as 6-1/2.</p>
<p>&quot;They said their sales headcount wouldn't go up fast enough,&quot; said Ed Bierdeman, analyst at Dakin Securities in San Francisco.  </p>
<p>After the market closed Monday, Clarify reported first-quarter net income of $1.95 million, or $0.09 a share, on revenue of $19.4 million -- about what Wall Street analysts expected.</p>
<p>But Clarify also said it expects &quot;little, if any,&quot; revenue growth in the second quarter compared with the first, because the company cannot hire enough sales people.</p>
<p>The company did not provide any more details about its revenue forecast.  </p>
<p>Clarify writes software that helps the customer-service department of companies keep track of customer complaints and requests. Clarify and other help-desk software companies have been seen their revenues double in recent quarters.</p>
<p>The dim revenue outlook from Clarify drove down other stocks in the help-desk niche. Remedy Corp fell 5-15/16 to 34-1/2. Vantive Corp fell 1-15/16 to 15-1/8. Scopus Technology Inc fell 4-7/8 to 23-1/4.</p>
<p>Bierdeman said Clarify and its rivals have a tough time showing Wall Street consistent and predictable revenue growth each quarter. Each sales contract usually takes months to complete, he said</p>
<p>PaineWebber Inc analyst John Faig downgraded the rating on Clarify to &quot;neutral&quot; from &quot;buy,&quot; officials at the investment bank said.</p>
<p>Bierdeman said today's drop is a buying opportunity for the stock of the stronger companies, including Siebel Systems Inc and Vantive.</p>
