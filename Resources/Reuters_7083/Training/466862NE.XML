<headline>Integrated Systems falters after downgrade.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-25</dateline>

<p>Shares of Integrated Systems Inc fell about 40 percent after Hambrecht &amp; Quist downgraded the stock to hold from buy.</p>
<p>Integrated Systems dropped seven to 10-1/8 and was one of the most heavily-traded Nasdaq issues.</p>
<p>Hambrect &amp; Quist analyst Sheila Ennis said she downgraded Integrated Systems due to the slower-than-expected rollout of its Prism Plus product line.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't believe in any way that this is 'game over,' but I'm just concerned that it could take a little longer to get the tools out there,&quot; Ennis said.  </p>
<p>The downgrade compounded news of Integrated System's expected earnings shortfall.  Integrated Systems said late Monday it expects its fourth quarter and fiscal 1997 earnings will fall short of analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>The company said in a statement it expects primary earnings per share for the fourth quarter of between $0.10 and $0.11 per share.</p>
<p>Earnings per share for the full year are estimated to be between $0.31 and $0.32, including merger related expenses. Excluding the merger related expenses, primary earnings per share for the year would be $0.46 to $0.47.  </p>
<p>On a consensus basis, analysts expected the company would earn $0.19 a share for the fourth quarter and $0.55 a share for the year, according to First Call.</p>
<p>Ennis said she trimmed her earnings estimates to $0.46 from $0.56 for the 1997 fiscal year ended February, and to $0.60 from $0.84 for 1998.</p>
<p>Integrated Systems, based in Santa Clara, Calif., makes software development tools that let computer chipmakers embed software on their microchips.</p>
