<p>Borland International Inc. stock jumped Wednesday, a day after the software tools maker startled Wall Street with a narrow first-quarter profit showing signs that its turnaround was taking shape.</p>
<p>&quot;We think we bottomed out in the third quarter,&quot; Borland Chief Executive Officer Delbert Yocam, who took the helm of the company last December, said in an interview.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the company reported a net profit of $79,000 for its first fiscal quarter ended on June 30, compared with a net loss of $21.8 million a year earlier. Sales rose 10 percent to $41.9 million.</p>
<p>The result was break-even in terms of earnings per share, but it was well above Zacks Investment Research's Wall Street consensus estimate of a loss of 19 cents a share. Borland stock rose 62.5 cents to $7.31 in active trading on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>&quot;We obviously want to continue to improve on both the top line and the bottom line each and every quarter during this turnaround,&quot; said Yocam, who declined to comment on details of the company's upcoming quarterly financial objectives.</p>
<p>Borland said in April it expected to be profitable in fiscal 1998 after taking more than $23 million in charges for a global restructuring and other one-time expenses.</p>
<p>The restructuring involved a 30 percent work force reduction. Borland's operating expenses fell by a third to $35.5 million in the latest quarter from $53.5 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Yocam's strategy includes providing greater stability for sales of Borland tools -- which are used by developers to make computer programs -- by producing either a new product or a major upgrade of an existing product each quarter.</p>
<p>In a research report, UBS Securities analysts said they raised their earnings estimates for the fiscal year ending in March 1998 to 10 cents a share from 1 cent a share.</p>
<p>&quot;The management team has moved swiftly in getting costs under control,&quot; the report said. &quot;We think the stock should finally start to move up here.&quot;</p>
<p>Borland, based in Scotts Valley, Calif., reported a $29.4 million loss in its third quarter ended last December.</p>
