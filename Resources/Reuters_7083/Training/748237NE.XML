<title>USA: US OPTIONS FOCUS/Alpha-Beta calls draw speculation.</title>
<headline>US OPTIONS FOCUS/Alpha-Beta calls draw speculation.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-07-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Implied volatilities for Alpha-Beta Technology Inc options soared and volume ballooned as speculators bet on the outcome of the firm's test of a key drug, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's become a very speculative issue,&quot; said Michael Young, a market-maker for the Alpha-Beta options at the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). &quot;It's been kind of running that way for a week, week and a half.&quot;</p>
<p>Alpha-Beta August 10.0 calls were the second heaviest traded contract on CBOE, with about 4,700 contracts changing hands by mid-afternoon.  </p>
<p>Implied volatility for the calls shot up to around 150 percent, compared with the stock's 60-day actual volatility of slightly above 70 percent.</p>
<p>The stock was up 1-3/16 at 9-5/8.</p>
<p>Alpha-Beta Technology's director of finance Bill Romeo declined to comment on the stock market activity and said nothing had been released by the company today.</p>
<p>Romeo, however, said the firm recently completed the phase-three trials of its Betafectin PGG-glucan at 40 sites and was expected to present preliminary results to a panel of independent infectious disease experts Thursday and Friday.  </p>
<p>Within two weeks, the company is expected to disclose preliminary results of the trials through a press release, he told Reuters. Once a full analysis of the trials is completed, results are to be presented at medical forum.</p>
<p>The drug developed by Massachusetts-based Alpha-Beta is expected to reduce the incidence of patients who develop a serious post-surgical infection after undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery.</p>
<p>Young at CBOE said a lot of the smaller retail orders coming in through the exchange's automated execution system were call selling, presumably buy-write activity.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, the larger professional orders coming into the pit were call buying, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;The professional side seems to be taking a bet that there's going to be a big move in the stock,&quot; he said. &quot;We don't really know what to make of it because there's been things written about it that this is kind of a make-or-break drug for the company.&quot;</p>
<p>The August 7.5 puts also had relatively good volume of more than 2,100 contracts.</p>
<p>&quot;People are trying to buy the puts as protection and maintain long positions,&quot; Young said.  </p>
<p>Elsewhere, Bay Networks Inc calls were active after the firm's better than expected earnings report released late Tuesday. August 32.5 calls traded 5,100 lots.</p>
<p>Dell Computer options were also hot as the stock gained 4-1/2 to 164-1/2, while bullish momentum players returned to Intel Corp calls.</p>
<p>Rod Jamieson, vice president of option strategies at EVEREN Securities, said technology issues were once again at center stage as the sector remained very choppy.</p>
<p>&quot;One day it's going one way, the next day it's going the other way,&quot; he said. &quot;It's perfect for option trading.&quot;</p>
