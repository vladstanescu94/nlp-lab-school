<title>USA: Objective Systems drops on earnings warning.</title>
<headline>Objective Systems drops on earnings warning.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares of Objective Systems Integrators Inc dropped about 46 percent after the company warned it would post a third quarter loss due to slowdowns in the competitive local exchange carrier market and the personal communications systems market.</p>
<p>Objective Systems, which develops networking software and tools, dropped 3-25/32 to 4-9/32 in heavy trading.</p>
<p>The Folsom, Calif.-based company also attributed part of the projected third quarter shortfall to a delay in finalizing some customer contracts at the end of the third quarter.  </p>
<p>Objective Systems said late Monday that it expects to post a loss of between $0.16 and $0.18 a share on revenues of about $10 million, compared with earnings of $0.06 a share on revenues of $13.8 million last year.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley also downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform.</p>
<p>Although Objective Systems had problems with a contract being delayed, Morgan Stanley said it believes Objective Systems' backlog increased sequentially from its &quot;modest&quot; levels at the year-end.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley also said it could take one or two quarters before customers began deploying in significant volumes Objective Systems' NetExpert Release 3.5, which became available on March 31.</p>
