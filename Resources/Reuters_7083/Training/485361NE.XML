<p>Walt Disney Co., eager to cash in on the popularity of the Internet, said Thursday its ABC News division will launch a 24-hour online news service later this month in partnership with America Online Inc., Netscape Communications Corp. and Starwave Corp.</p>
<p>The Burbank, Calif.-based entertainment giant also announced plans to acquire a major stake in Starwave, the Web site company owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and the producer of such popular Web sites as ESPNET SportsZone, Mr. Showbiz, NBA.com and NFL.com.</p>
<p>Disney did not disclose financial terms of the deal, but analysts estimated it spent about $100 million to acquire a third of Starwave.</p>
<p>Under terms of the deal, Disney will assume operating control of the company. Allen, who remains the company's largest shareholder, gave Disney an option to purchase his remaining interest in Starwave, exercisable over the next five years.</p>
<p>PaineWebber Inc. analyst Christopher Dixon said the moves are aimed at positioning Disney for the future and competing with rival online news service MSNBC, a joint venture between Microsoft Corp. and NBC News.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly they're buying into the notion, as NBC has, in what I would describe as the micronetwork,&quot; he said. &quot;The future of television is really not going to be platform specific. It's going to shift from broadcast to cable and now to the Internet platform.&quot;</p>
<p>Jeff Gralnick, the executive in charge of the new online venture, said the division will have a staff of 40 reporters and editors in New York. In addition to national and international news, the venture will offer local news through links to ABC affiliate stations around the country.</p>
<p>&quot;The local piece of this, for totality of reporting, and to drive traffic for us and them is really important,&quot; Gralnick said. &quot;What we want to be is a true news on demand service.&quot;</p>
<p>Further down the road, he said the service will offer columnists, increased use of audio and video clips and a broadcast type service that would compete with traditional cable television channels.</p>
<p>Last year, ABC News dropped plans to launch a 24-hour cable news channel because it was too expensive. However, with the convergance of the Internet and television, the concept could be revived as part of the online business.</p>
<p>Gralnick said the new venture was not expected to turn a profit until the year 2000, but after that it could provide several million dollars worth of profits to Disney.</p>
<p>Smith Barney analyst Jill Krutick said the all-news service was an important part of Disney's strategy.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe they view it as a very important medium of the future and they want to get in early and get a place in people's minds,&quot; she said. &quot;I believe the Internet is here to stay and is only going to grow in popularity as it evolves.&quot;</p>
<p>Disney said the ABC News site would be free to Web surfers. Earlier this week, Disney announced a new fee-based on-line service for children. The subscription service, called &quot;Daily Blast&quot; will debut in late April. Disney said it will offer a mix of on-line games, animated stories and news at a cost of $4.95 a month, or $39.95 for an annual subscription.</p>
<p>The service will also be available free of charge to members of Microsoft Corp.'s MSN.</p>
<p>Disney said ABCNEWS.com would have unprecedented distribution to more than 16 million people each day via the 12 million daily users of America Online and 4 million daily users of Netscape.</p>
<p>ABC News will be America Online's premier television and radio news provider, giving America Online members a customised version of ABCNEWS.com. ABC News and America Online will promote ABCNEWS.com on the air and online.</p>
<p>In addition, Netscape will create a special ABC News headline on its home page that will allow vistors to read the latest headlines.</p>
<p>ABC's move comes as a number of media companies are increasing their presence on the Web. Earlier this month, CBS bought a 22 percent stake in Internet SportsLine USA, a provider of sports information and scores.</p>
<p>The new service, called CBS SportsLine, will offer scores, statistics, live radio and other feature information.</p>
<p>Later this year, CBS plans to launch a similar online news service that will provide news and information via arrangements with CBS affiliates.</p>
