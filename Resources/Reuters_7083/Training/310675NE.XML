<p>Rupert Murdoch's campaign for Chinese favour bore electronic fruit on Wednesday when a venture by his News Corp Ltd and China's People's Daily launched an online computer information service, company officials said.</p>
<p>The ChinaByte Internet site would supply information technology news and data in Chinese to the growing army of Chinese users of the worldwide computer network, said officials of the joint venture, PDN Xinren Information Technology Co.</p>
<p>The service was the first fruit of a $5.4 million 20-year joint venture between News Corp and the flagship Communist Party newspaper -- a 1995 venture seen as a key step in media baron Murdoch's attempts to penetrate China's news market.</p>
<p>ChinaByte, with most of its $2.5 million investment from News Corp, would earn revenue mainly through advertising.</p>
<p>It aimed to cut delays faced by Chinese Internet surfers trying to keep up with information technology changes via the English-dominated network, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;What we want to do with ChinaByte... is put (Chinese users) back on an equal footing with their Western counterparts,&quot; PDN Xinren General Manager Bruce Dover told a news briefing.</p>
<p>ChinaByte included an online database of computer companies in China and technology news and software licensed from U.S. computer magazine producer Ziff-Davis Publishing Co, which is owned by Japan's Softbank Corp, he said.</p>
<p>The site, located at http://www.chinabyte.com, already had about 900 freely downloadable software programs accompanied by Chinese language reviews and ratings supplied by Ziff-Davis.</p>
<p>The software made available would be carefully vetted to make sure it did not offend Chinese sensibilities, said Adam Power, managing director of Ziff-Davis Publishing Co (Asia).</p>
<p>&quot;You wouldn't see anything that is morally unacceptable on our sites,&quot; Power said.</p>
<p>Analysts say getting along with China's often highly sensitive officials is a key part of News Corp's strategy for development in the potentially huge Chinese media market.</p>
<p>Murdoch himself angered Beijing in 1993 when he said satellite television and telecommunications posed an &quot;unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere&quot;, but he has since largely worked his way back into Chinese favour.</p>
<p>In 1994, Murdoch complied with a public request from Beijing to stop broadcasting the British Broadcasting Corporation to China via his STAR TV satellite service and his Harper Collins unit agreed to publish the English version of a biography of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>The June 1995 creation of the PDN Xinren venture with a People's Daily subsidiary was seen as a vital step towards improving News Corp's image in China, although officials admitted it had taken longer than expected to start operations.</p>
<p>&quot;It took us a long time to set up this office,&quot; said Dover, adding that training staff and arranging Internet access had been the source of much of the delay.</p>
<p>While the scale of Chinese Internet use was still unclear, PND Xinren expected rapid growth and was encouraged by increasing official acceptance of the network, he said.</p>
<p>Blocks reported to have been placed by Beijing last year on international news Internet sites had been lifted, and even the People's Daily newspaper itself had entered cyberspace with a site at http://www.peopledaily.co.cn, he said.</p>
<p>China was embracing the Internet, Dover said.</p>
<p>&quot;They are not trying to strangle it, as we thought for a while,&quot; he said.</p>
