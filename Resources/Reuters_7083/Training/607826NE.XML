<p>State prosecutors in Frankfurt said on Thursday an insider dealing probe into German software group SAP AG had produced no evidence of wrongdoing among 71 staff with direct access to corporate financial data.</p>
<p>Investigations would now concentrate on four employees with less access to sensitive information but surrounding whom there was still &quot;a certain suspicion&quot; of insider share-trading, a spokesman for the prosecutors' office said.</p>
<p>He added that none of the four employees was either a member of SAP's management or supervisory board and that the case could be closed in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Earlier, SAP had said in a statement that, after questioning of company workers, the suspicion of illegal trading by so-called primary insiders had been &quot;largely refuted&quot;.</p>
<p>Prosecutors had investigated whether around 100 SAP staff had dealt in shares and derivatives to try and cash in ahead of poor quarterly results announced last October which led to a fall of nearly a quarter in the company's share price.</p>
<p>The SAP statement added that further preventive measures would be taken to prevent insider trading. Hopp told a magazine recently that staff would be asked to observe a ban on trading company stock in the three weeks before results are announced.</p>
