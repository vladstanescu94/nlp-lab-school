<headline>Novonyx taps Novell executive as CEO.</headline>

<p>Novonyx, the private company formed by Novell Inc. and Netscape Communications Corp. in March, said Monday it had named Robert Hicks and four other former Novell officials to top executive positions.</p>
<p>Novonyx also said the U.S. government has completed its regulatory review of the joint venture under the government's Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust procedures and has told the company it has terminated its mandatory waiting period early.</p>
<p>Hicks, who headed the four-person Novell executive team which developed and negotiated the joint venture, will serve as president and chief executive of the new company.</p>
<p>Eric Schmidt, newly appointed chairman and chief executive of Novell, will serve as chairman of the Novonyx board, which also includes Hicks, Novell President Joe Marengi and John Paul, vice president of strategic programs at Netscape.</p>
<p>Hicks said the company, which is adapting and marketing Netscape's SuiteSpot family of Internet server software for use on Novell's IntranetWare corporate network platrform, has 12 full-time employees and plans to raise this to 70 by year end.</p>
<p>&quot;IntranetWare is growing on a year-to-year rate of approximately 85 percent in the U.S. and Canada and approximately 40 overseas, so we believe that its a great opportunity to deliver Netscape's world class server products on intranetware,&quot; he said in a brief telephone interview.</p>
<p>Paul said Netscape has established seven positions to support the venture in development, support and marketing to ensure the product &quot;is a real tier one platform.&quot;</p>
<p>First products are expected this fall and the goal is for future Netscape server products to roll out for IntranetWare at the same time as they are released for Unix and Microsoft Corp's Windows NT system.</p>
<p>Thomas Creighton, formerly lead architect for Novell's NetWare Systems Devision, will be Novonyx's vice president of engineering and William Donahoo, a former senior director in Novell's IntranetWare Products Division, will serve as vice president of marketing at Novonyx.</p>
<p>Ty Mattingly, a former Novell vice president of strategic relations, has become vice president of sales and business development at Novonyx, while Steven Bentley has become chief financial officer at the new company. Previously, Bentley was a senior director of Novell's Extended Networks Division.</p>
<p>A Novell official said Novell had reached &quot;a handshake agreement&quot; with Novonyx to allow it to hire a limited number of further Novell employees. A significant share of Novonyx will be owned by its employees, but no details were released.</p>
