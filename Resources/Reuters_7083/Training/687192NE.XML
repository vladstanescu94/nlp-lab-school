<p>Microsoft Corp. and Netscape Communications Corp. on Tuesday said they received U.S. government permission to export Internet software that uses strong security technology.</p>
<p>The two companies said in separate news releases that they had received licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce permitting them to supply the strong encryption in products sold to banks to protect global online financial transactions.</p>
<p>The Clinton administration has been resisting loosening the government's grip on export of encryption, which has long been regulated as a munition under Cold War laws, but last month it agreed to waive restrictions for financial encryption systems.</p>
<p>Until now, U.S. authorities had forbidden computer companies from selling software that featured strong 128-bit encryption technology, arguing that criminals could use the software to make their electronic communication indecipherable to law enforcement officers.</p>
<p>Netscape said being able to sell Internet software that allows secure communication will encourage new financial markets, such as online banking, to develop.</p>
<p>Netscape, based in Mountain View, Calif., will export its new browser, Netscape Communicator, with 128-bit encryption, the company said. It will also export its Netscape SuiteSpot software package -- used to manage computers running Web sites -- with 128-bit encryption to certified banks worldwide.</p>
<p>Privately-held VeriSign, whose business is based on being a third party that can issue, manage and authenticate digital certificates, will serve as the certificate authority for Netscape's products, the company said.</p>
<p>VeriSign is also headquartered in Mountain View.</p>
<p>In a separate announcemnt from its corporate headquarters in Redmond, Wash., Microsoft Corp. said it had also been granted a license permitting it to export products using 128-bit encryption security between banks and their customers.</p>
<p>The technology will be incorporated into Microsoft products beginning with Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0, Microsoft Money 98 and Microsoft Information Server, the company said.</p>
<p>But Netscape officials said that Microsoft's next-generation Internet Explorer 4.0 is not yet in public beta testing, and is not expected to ship as a final product for months, while Netscape's product is on the market.</p>
<p>A Microsoft product manager said Internet Explorer 4.0 is scheduled to enter beta testing in July and to be released by summer's end.</p>
<p>Encryption technology is software that scrambles sensitive information and makes it unreadable to anyone that does not have the right &quot;key.&quot; The strength of the lock depends on the length of the numerical key. Until now, Netscape had to rely on relatively weak 40-bit keys when selling software outside the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>Netscape's stock rose $1.69 to close at $35.75 on Nasdaq, while Microsoft shares soared $4 to $132.06.</p>
