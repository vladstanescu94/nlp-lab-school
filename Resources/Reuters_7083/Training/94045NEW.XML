<title>USA: Microsoft sees momentum in Internet browser.</title>

<p>Microsoft Corp is seeing great momentum in its Internet Explorer software to browse the World Wide Web, and its market share has doubled in recent weeks since it introduced the latest upgrade, a Microsoft executive said.</p>
<p>The software giant is also working on more deals with other Internet access providers, similar to the deal announced earlier Thursday with AT&amp;T Corp, said Brad Chase, general manager and vice president of developer relations and marketing.</p>
<p>&quot;We do have a relationship with other access providers, but I don't want to make any announcements today,&quot; Chase told reporters on a conference call to announce its deal with AT&amp;T.  </p>
<p>Chase said that since Microsoft introduced Internet Explorer version 3.0, its share of the Internet browser market, which is dominated by Netscape Communications Corp and its Navigator software, has doubled.</p>
<p>&quot;We have doubled our share in the last six weeks,&quot; Chase said, adding that Microsoft's share has jumped to about 10 to 20 percent of the Internet browser market, up from between five to 10 percent. He added that some World Wide Web sites are even showing a 30 percent market share.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very excited about the continued momentum in the downloads we have had,&quot; Chase said. &quot;We are pretty pumped up.&quot;  </p>
<p>When asked if Chase had any qualms about announcing yet another deal with an online access provider, in light of another investigation by the U.S. Justice Department into Microsoft's marketing tactics, Chase said he did not know any details of the DOJ's investigation.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Microsoft said that the DOJ had notified the company that it will seek additional information regarding its competitive practices. The investigation is believed to focus on the Internet browser market, after Netscape asked the DOJ to investigate whether the software giant's marketing tactics violate its 1994 consent decree with the government.  </p>
<p>&quot;To my knowledge that is not what they are investigating at all and I don't know any of the details at all,&quot; Chase said. &quot;It's sad that our competitors are seeking government intervention...We are very proud of the progress we have made.&quot;</p>
<p>Tom Evslin, vice president, AT&amp;T WorldNet Service, said that AT&amp;T has selected Internet Explorer as its primary Web browser instead of Netscape because of requests from its customers.</p>
<p>He said customers have said that one of the main obstacles of getting online is the installation process. &quot;There is no installation like no installation and that is what we have arranged with Microsoft,&quot; Evslin said.  </p>
<p>As part of its deal with AT&amp;T, Microsoft will offer AT&amp;T WorldNet Service software bundled with the Windows 95 operating system, and it will appear as an icon in the online services folder when users start up their new PCs.</p>
<p>He said WorldNet is already being included in new PCs shipping now and that by Christmas, the majority of PCs shipped will have AT&amp;T WorldNet pre-installed. Another feature of Internet Explorer that AT&amp;T was impressed with, Evslin said, is Microsoft's promise to give customers free upgrades of its browser software &quot;forever.&quot; He also said that AT&amp;T's customers are asking for Internet Explorer, after many positive reviews.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are giving customers a choice,&quot; Evslin said, adding that customers can still use Netscape Navigator with the WorldNet Service. But Internet Explorer is its preferred software.</p>
