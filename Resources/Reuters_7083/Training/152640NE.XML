<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Options weigh on CompUSA shares.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-10-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Options trading kept pressure on CompUSA Inc shares Wednesday as investors bought calls and sold the stock as it declined, traders said.</p>
<p>By 1200 CST (1800 GMT), CompUSA was down six at 45-5/8 on consolidated volume of 3.6 million shares. It reached a session low of 45-3/8.</p>
<p>Traders said investors were being aggressive with both the options and the stock.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of the options is dealing with stock replacement,&quot; one trader in Chicago said. &quot;Especially in the front month, which is rather interesting.&quot;  </p>
<p>The trader said he expected more action in the back months.</p>
<p>&quot;That's one reason the stock is seeing so much pressure here is you've got people coming in and buying the calls and selling the stock back out,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Buying calls and selling stock is equivalent to a synthetic put position.</p>
<p>Volatility in the November calls was trading in the low to mid-60's.</p>
<p>Traders said business was mixed between retail and institutional investors.  </p>
<p>The CompUSA November 50 call was the most active, with a total of 1,975 contracts changing hands. Its open interest was roughly 1,810.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the premium on the CompUSA November 50 call was 1-1/4, a 2-1/2-point decline from Tuesday's close. On the American Stock Exchange, the premium was 1-5/16, down 2-3/16.</p>
<p>Other active CompUSA calls included the November 45 and November 55. The most active call outside the November series was the December 50, which traded 278 contracts on the CBOE.  </p>
<p>On the put side, the CompUSA November 40 traded a total of 961 contracts, the November 45 traded 674 and the November 50 traded 710.</p>
<p>In other action, a couple of large spreads were seen in shares of Newbridge Networks Corp and Banc One Corp.</p>
<p>On the Pacific Stock Exchange, the Newbridge November 32-1/2 put traded 1,560 contracts and the November 35 put traded 1,670.</p>
<p>Most of the action in both those options was spreads, traders said. Newbridge shares rose 1-3/8 to 31-3/8.  </p>
<p>Also on the PSE, the Banc One November 32-1/2 call and the May 40 call each traded 2,800 contracts.</p>
<p>Calls on shares of Bay Networks Inc were active on the CBOE as the stock rallied in heavy trade, traders said.</p>
<p>The shares were up two at 20-1/2 on consolidated volume of 4.8 million shares.</p>
<p>The November 20 call traded more than 2,900 contracts, the December 20 call traded about 1,030 and the November 22-1/2 traded about 975.</p>
