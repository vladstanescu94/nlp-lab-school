<title>USA: Microsoft media job growth seen slowing.</title>

<p>Microsoft Corp.'s money-losing interactive media group will expand its work force by 15 to 20 percent in the next year, down from a more than 40 percent increase last year, a company executive said.</p>
<p>Denise White, director of new ventures, declined in an interview to say how many people worked in the group, which includes online services such as the Microsoft Network and Slate magazine, as well as entertainment and information products like the Encarta CD-ROM encyclopaedia.</p>
<p>Overall, Microsoft employed 22,276 people when its fiscal year ended June 30, an increase of 8 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p>White said interactive media growth is slowing after a year that saw the launch of major online ventures, including the Expedia travel service and Sidewalk, a guide to local arts and entertainment that has been rolled out in four cities.</p>
<p>&quot;We were investing in a number of different areas,&quot; White said. &quot;We started seven new online products.&quot;</p>
<p>Over the coming year, executives of the group plan to identify the most promising opportunities, such as games, and &quot;stabilize&quot; the work force, White said.</p>
<p>She also said the group would reduce the number of contract workers it employs now that many of its major products are beyond the launch phase.</p>
<p>Last month, group vice president Pete Higgins told analysts and reporters the interactive media businesses would lose &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars&quot; over the coming year and Microsoft would begin &quot;tightening the screws&quot; on investments.</p>
<p>&quot;But make no mistake,&quot; he said. &quot;We continue to be very serious about this business, and serious about winning.&quot;</p>
<p>White pointed out that &quot;15 percent is still a really sizable growth for a group to sustain.&quot;</p>
<p>The group does not include one of Microsoft's most visible media ventures, the MSNBC joint news venture with NBC.</p>
