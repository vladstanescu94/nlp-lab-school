<p>Lehman Brothers analyst Brian Oakes said he started coverage on three internet companies, CNET Inc, Excite Corp and Yahoo Inc.</p>
<p>-- In a research report, Oakes said he started CNET with a neutral rating. It operates a World Wide Web data site that integrates some of the television programming it produces.  </p>
<p>-- Oakes said CNET has the very difficult and necessary task ahead of moving into the mass market. It announced a new advertising-supported Web service, Snap!, that could eventually compete with America Online Inc, Compuserve Corp , and Yahoo Inc, but &quot;success is not right around the corner,&quot; he said in the report.</p>
<p>-- &quot;Given its high current valuation at 10.7 times 1997 revenues and uncertainty brought on by Snap, we are cautious on the stock until signs of success become more clear&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>-- Shares slipped 1/8 to 27-5/8.  </p>
<p>-- Oakes started coverage of Excite Corp with an outperform rating and gave the stock a target of $17 a share. He cited the company's near-leadership position on the Internet and its resolution of financing problems. He said Excite is poised to leverage its backing by AOL and Intuit Inc, which each own about 20 percent of Excite.</p>
<p>-- Shares rose 5/8 to 14-3/8.</p>
<p>-- He started Yahoo with a neutral, saying the company has excellent brand name recognition but very high valuations. The stock trades at 21.7 times his 1997 revenue estimate and 78 times his 1998 earnings estimate.  </p>
<p>-- He said much of the good news is already built into the stock, and &quot;we would be more comfortable with the stock in the high 20s or low 30s&quot;.</p>
<p>-- Shares slipped 1-1/4 to 36.</p>
