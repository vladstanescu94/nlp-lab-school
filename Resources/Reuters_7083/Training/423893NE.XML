<headline>RTRS-Australia's Telstra in global alliance talks.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-03-07</dateline>

<p>Australia's largest telecommunications group, the state-owned Telstra Corp, said on Friday it continued to have talks with other large telecommunications players about forming global alliances or joint ventures.  </p>
<p>&quot;Telstra continues to pursue discussions with significant telecommunications, information and technology players with a view to forming global co-operative arrangements such as alliances or joint ventures,&quot; Telstra said in its first half results statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Geographically, Telstra continues to seek value creating opportunities in Asia which align with its international strategy,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>Earlier, Telstra reported a fall in net profit for the six months to A$742 million from A$1.205 billion in the previous comparable period. But this included a A$1.026 billion abnormal loss because of redundancies and restructuring costs. Operating profit rose to A$2.12 billion from A$1.85 billion.</p>
<p>Last week newspapers reported that Telstra Corp had been in talks with British Telecommunications Plc to forge a global alliance.  </p>
<p>The reports said a deal between Telstra, BT and its United States merger partner MCI Communications Corp would have major competitive implications in Australia's telecoms market, which is to be deregulated from July 1.</p>
<p>It also said Telstra was still involved in high-level talks with other potential partners, including U.S. information technology giant International Business Machines Corp.</p>
<p>BT deputy chief executive Alan Rudge said last week that the company was unlikely to buy a stake in Telstra when it was privatised.  </p>
<p>In early December, the Liberal-National coalition government won parliamentary approval to sell one-third of Telstra in a plan expected to raise about A$8.0 billion for the government.</p>
<p>Under the legislation, foreign investors are limited to 11.7 percent of Telstra with no individual foreigner able to buy more than five percent.</p>
<p>Telstra also has an internet joint venture with Microsoft</p>
