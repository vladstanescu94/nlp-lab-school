<p>The Clinton administration this week is stepping up its campaign to block Congressional efforts to ease strict U.S. export controls on computer encoding technology.</p>
<p>A House International Relations Committee subcommittee easily approved legislation on Tuesday to lift most of the restrictions on encryption programs, software that scrambles information and renders if unreadable without a password or software &quot;key.&quot;  </p>
<p>But the bill, passed on a 14 to 1 vote, must still be approved by the full committee, where the administration sees an opening to torpedo the legislation.</p>
<p>Although a slim majority of members on the committee are among the 133 co-sponsors of the bill, committee chairman Benjamin Gilman, Republican of New York, is not a strong supporter, congressional staffers said. The committee is expected to vote on the bill shortly after returning from the July 4th recess.  </p>
<p>Top administration officials, including Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Louis Freeh, will visit Capitol Hill Wednesday and Thursday to make the case against relaxing export controls.</p>
<p>Freeh will testify at an open hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday and provide House lawmakers with a classified briefing on Thursday.</p>
<p>Encryption is increasingly used to safeguard electronic commerce and global communications over the Internet. But the technology can also be used by criminals to protect their communications from law enforcement agency wiretaps.  </p>
<p>Freeh and other officials argue that powerful encryption should only be exported if it includes features allowing the government to crack the codes by gaining access to the software keys.</p>
<p>The U.S. software industry counters that unregulated foreign competitors are gaining market share by selling encryption that lacks so-called key recovery features.</p>
<p>Sun Microsystems recently said it would market Russian-made encryption with some of its export products, for example.  </p>
<p>On Tuesday, Netscape Communications Corp and Microsoft Corp both announced they had received government permission to export powerful encryption for use in financial transactions.</p>
<p>The two vocal proponents of export liberalization continue to oppose the administration's position, company officials said.</p>
<p>The Business Software Alliance, which includes Microsoft, hailed the subcommittee vote.</p>
<p>&quot;This critical piece of legislation will level the playing field for U.S. publishers,&quot; Alliance president Robert Holleyman said. &quot;Without question, the realization of a fully developed Internet thriving with electronic commerce is contigent on it.&quot;</p>
<p>Civil liberties and privacy advocates also back the legislation. Subcommittee chairwomen Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, said the support of such groups has been critical to moving the legislation forward.</p>
<p>Noting that the House leadership is not &quot;fully behind&quot; the bill, she said after the vote the leaders &quot;understand there is a lot of grassroots support, industry support and civil liberties support.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They would have definitely stripped it had not the industry groups and others been there,&quot; she added.</p>
