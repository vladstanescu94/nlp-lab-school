<p>Informix Corp. on Thursday reported a huge first-quarter loss, as expected, and unveiled a restructuring plan that will include job cuts and an unspecified charge in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Informix, the second-biggest publisher of database software, also said Chief Financial Officer Alan Henricks, who had been on the job only since January, resigned.</p>
<p>The company, based in Menlo Park, Calif., said it will not report a profit for at least another two quarters.</p>
<p>Informix is reeling from product miscues. In December, the compay introduced Universal Server, an advanced database product.</p>
<p>Although Informix's new products have been praised by technology analysts, customers so far have not been willing to base critical record-keeping systems on them.</p>
<p>Informix reported a first-quarter loss of $140.1 million, or 93 cents a share, compared with net income of $15.9 million, or 10 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago. The company had warned a month ago that it would report a significant loss.</p>
<p>First-quarter revenue plunged 34 percent to $133.7 million from $204 million.</p>
<p>Informix said it will shut some operations and lay off an unspecified number of workers. To cover the cost, the company will take a charge in the second quarter, which ends in June.</p>
<p>The company also consolidated various product sales teams into one group.</p>
<p>&quot;It will take the second quarter to get in shape. It will take the third-quarter to get business to ramp up, and hopefully by the end of the year we'll break even,&quot; said Phil White, Informix chief executive.</p>
<p>The company also said CFO Henricks resigned. White said he understood Henrick's decision to leave. Henricks was caught by surprise by the size of Informix's shortfall.</p>
<p>&quot;Alan came here to be part of a billion-dollar software company,&quot; White said. &quot;He doesn't feel this is the place he wants to be going forward.&quot;</p>
<p>In a statement, Henricks said the decision was difficult &quot;coming as it does at an awkward time for Informix. This is a company with excellent products.&quot;</p>
<p>In early trading on Nasdaq, Informix shares were down 50 cents at $6.813.</p>
