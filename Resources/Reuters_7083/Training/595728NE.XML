<text>
<p>Oracle Corp. and Netscape Communications Corp. said Monday they agreed to merge two of their affiliates to develop Internet access software for open standards-based network computers and other Internet appliances.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the definitive agreement were not disclosed.</p>
<p>The new company, NCI, will combine the engineering, marketing, technology, brands and products of Netscape's Navio Communications and Oracle's Network Computer Inc., both of which were formed last year. It will be based in a new facility in San Francisco's Bay area.</p>
<p>Oracle and Network Computer will retain majority ownership in NCI and account for the deal as a purchase transaction. Netscape will have an equity interest in the new company.</p>
<p>&quot;Together we'll continue to work with all our alliance members to develop open standards-based technology for network computing,&quot; said Jerry Baker, chief executive of Network Computer.</p>
<p>&quot;Our combined efforts will accelerate the adoption of network computers in the consumer, corporate and education markets and make the power of the Internet available to everyone.&quot;</p>
<p>Baker will become chief executive of NCI, while Navio President and Chief Executive Wei Yen will be president of NCI. Netscape President and Chief Executive Jim Barksdale and Oracle Chairman and Chief Executive Larry Ellison will serve on the NCI board.</p>
<p>The merger is subject to government approval.</p>
<p>Navio, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., is a software company that develops and delivers Internet solutions to companies and consumers on non-PC devices.</p>
<p>Network Computer develops, licenses and markets software, technology and support services.</p>
<p>Oracle, based in Redwood City, Calif., is the world's leading supplier of software for information management and the world's second-largest software company.</p>
<p>Netscape, based in Mountain View, Calif., is a leading provider of open software for linking people and information over enterprise networks and the Internet.</p>
<p>Netscape's stock rose $1.25 to $30.50, while Oracle edged down 25 5 cents to $44.125, both on Nasdaq.</p>
