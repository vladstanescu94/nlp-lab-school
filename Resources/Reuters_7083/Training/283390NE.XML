<p>In the latest warning that computer sales have cooled, electronics retailer CompUSA Inc reported same store sales in December at half the levels expected by Wall Street.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected consumer electronics and personal computer retailers to have a weak holiday season, since a dearth of new and improved gadgets did not encourage shoppers.  </p>
<p>CompUSA reported same-store sales growth of 1.5 percent for December, which is half what analysts were expecting. CompUSA's shares fell about 25 percent to 16, off 4-5/8, on approximately 5.9 million shares of volume.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a tough business to make money in,&quot; Smith Barney vice president and retailing analyst Maureen McGrath said about personal computer sales.</p>
<p>The lack of a new series Intel Corp chips for personal computers or a Microsoft Corp Windows 95 software release has given little incentive for computer buyers, she said.  </p>
<p>Industrywide, electronics retailers have had little reason to cheer during the holidays.</p>
<p>Tandy Corp closed its Incredible Universe stores and 19 Computer City locations that have drained earnings.</p>
<p>Best Buy Co and Circuit City Stores Inc reported lower earnings for the November quarter with Best Buy reporting its first quarterly loss in a decade.  </p>
<p>The performance of mid-sized retailers in the $300 million to $400 million annual revenue range has been grim.</p>
<p>For example, shares of Campo Electronics, Appliances and Computers Inc and Tops Appliance City Inc have been trading below $3 a share much of 1996 to present levels of barely above $1 a share after both companies reported two consecutive quarters of losses.</p>
<p>McGrath said office supply stores and consumer electronics stores are rethinking about how much space they want to devote to personal computers.  </p>
<p>Chicago Corp senior retailing analyst Mark Mandel said consumer confidence is high, but there has been no good reason for customers to shop for electronics without new products, Mandel said. First time computer buyers have masked weakness in the audio and video component sales, he said.</p>
<p>Digital video discs and high definition television (HDTV) will be the next innovations for gadget buyers, but those products will not be available until late 1997, Mandel said.</p>
<p>Noting that the economy has been growing for six years, Mandel said consumer electronics companies tend to perform well shortly after recessions from pent up demand for high-priced goods.</p>
