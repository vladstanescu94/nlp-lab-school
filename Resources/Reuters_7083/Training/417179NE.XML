<p>Corel Corp is poised to scoop up more market share from huge U.S. rival Microsoft Corp with up to five deals to put its office software on new computers, Chief Executive Michael Cowpland said.</p>
<p>Cowpland told Reuters in an interview on Monday that the deals, which could mean yearly sales of about two million software units, would be announced in the next two to three months.</p>
<p>He said &quot;that will give us about seven million units a year&quot; when added to last summer's agreement with Packard Bell NEC Inc. Packard Bell NEC is a unit of NEC Corp.</p>
<p>Ottawa-based Corel took on Microsoft, which is about 30 times its size with yearly revenues of almost $9 billion, when it acquired office suite software company WordPerfect from Novell Inc in January 1996. Corel posted 1996 revenues of $334 million for the year ended November 30.</p>
<p>Cowpland added that Corel was gaining market share and now had up to 20 to 25 percent of total office suite sales.</p>
<p>Another salvo was the launch of more specialized software suites, with one aimed at the legal profession, to join products for engineers and doctors, Cowpland said.</p>
<p>He said Corel would unveil the legal software this month, priced at twice the $200 regular office suite. It began shipping the medical product two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Corel Chief Financial Officer Chuck Norris said the company's results for the first quarter ended in late February would be in the range of analysts' estimates. Forecasts ranged from nil to a loss of $0.11 a share on revenues of $85 million to $102 million.</p>
<p>Corel's fourth-quarter earnings rose to $6.5 million or $0.09 a share from a year earlier loss of $956,000 or $0.02 a share. For full-year 1996, Corel lost $2,750,000 or $0.04 a share.</p>
