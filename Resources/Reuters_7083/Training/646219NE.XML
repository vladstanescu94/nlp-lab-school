<p>Sales of goods and services used to build and access the Internet will top $100 billion by the year 2000, nearly triple sales of $34.97 billion in 1996, Zona Research said Monday.</p>
<p>Zona characterized the Internet market as goods and services used to actually build and service Internet infrastructure. It does not include other types of products sold over the Internet.  </p>
<p>Zona forecast the creation of large, global combines of information companies into what it calls &quot;info-keiretsu&quot;. Keiretsu are Japanese corporate groupings centered around a trading house, bank or maunfacturing firm linked by intertwined management, cross shareholdings and long-term relationships between users and suppliers.</p>
<p>Zona said Microsoft Corp was a bandleader in one such &quot;info-keiretsu&quot;, forming alliances with General Electric Co Digital Equipment Corp Hewlett-Packard Co and others.  </p>
<p>Zona Research said its report aimed to ascertain the market for goods and services based on Internet standards used in the communications infrastructure, compared to Internet-related electronic commerce as a whole.</p>
<p>Zona executives differentiated what they call Adjusted Gross Internet Product, as the value of services and goods such as software, hardware and Internet access services, compared with Gross Internet Product, which includes this plus the value of all goods and services sold via the Internet.</p>
<p>&quot;The way to make money on the Internet area is probably by selling bandwidth,&quot; said Zona President Stephen Auditore.  </p>
<p>Communications, including Internet-related equipment such as routers and modems along with services by providers of Internet access and consultants, accounted for half of all Internet-related sales in 1996, for a total of $20.36 billion, Zona said.</p>
<p>&quot;We've always known that the bandwith area is really where the bucks were,&quot; said Auditore. He predicted that communications would remain the largest segment for Intranet infrastructure, despite the tendency of media and investor attention to focus on browser wars between Microsoft and Netscape Communications Corp..  </p>
<p>&quot;Eighty percent of the hype is given to people generating about 20 percent of the revenue,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The containment sector -- Internet servers, server software, site hosting and services and maintenance, was the second-largest segment in 1996 with sales of $7.74 billion. Internet content accounted for sales of $3.40 billion, Zona said.</p>
<p>Zona predicted Internet communications sector sales will jump to $62.8 billion in 2000, when the total market for building the Internet and related internal corporate intranet networks should reach nearly $107 billion.  </p>
<p>&quot;We see the content area growing substantially as more services enter the Internet space,&quot; Auditore said in a conference call with reporters highlighting Zona's report.</p>
<p>Zona projected that Microsoft would continue to be a leader of the Internet market. Auditore noted Microsoft continued to expand its keiretsu earlier Monday with its announcement of a $1 billion investment in cable television provider Comcast Corp..</p>
<p>Auditore said the evolution of broad standards would help companies in different industry keiretsu work together.</p>
<p>Another keiretsu links International Business Machines Corp. with players such as AT&amp;T Corp, while an alliance Zona dubbed &quot;The NC Keiretsu&quot; to promote new, simpler Network Computers, links Sun Microsystems Inc. and Oracle Corp..</p>
<p>Some companies, like Hewlett-Packard Co., Netscape and Novell Inc. play across several of the keiretsu, Zona noted in a graphic depiction of the emerging groupings.</p>
