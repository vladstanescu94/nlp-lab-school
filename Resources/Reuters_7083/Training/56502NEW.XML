<p>---PRESS RELEASE--------------------------------</p>
<p>Intuit Unveils Internet Initiative to Further Revolutionize Finances For Individuals and Small Businesses; Intuit Will Open Its Product Family to Direct Connections Using the Internet</p>
<p>Business Editors/Computer Writers</p>
<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 16, 1996--Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU) today announced a far-reaching initiative designed to accelerate the adoption of electronic financial data exchange and communication by individuals, small businesses and their financial services providers.  As part of this effort, Intuit will open its best-selling financial software and Web-based services to direct connections with financial services providers using the Internet.  To facilitate building these links, Intuit will coordinate the development of the industry's most comprehensive framework for exchanging financial data electronically, an integrated collection of easy-to-use specifications and protocols called OpenExchange.</p>
<p>In a related move, Intuit has received a significant equity stake in CheckFree Corp. (NASDAQ: CKFR) in exchange for ownership of Intuit's back-end bill payment and private network subsidiary, Intuit Services Corp. (ISC), based in Downer's Grove, Illinois. (For more information on OpenExchange and the sale of ISC to CheckFree, see separate news releases.)</p>
<p>&quot;Our goal is to speed the adoption of electronic connections between individuals, small businesses and financial services providers,&quot; said Scott Cook, co-founder and chairman of Intuit.  &quot;Two years ago, our strategy was to offer a secure private network connection between our customers and financial services providers. Today, rapid advances in the safety and reliability of the Internet -- as well as its phenomenal acceptance by individuals, small businesses and financial services providers -- make the Internet the central focus of our overall connectivity and business strategy.&quot; 12 Million Customers, More than 100 Financial Services Providers</p>
<p>With more than 12 million individual and small business customers around the world, Intuit is uniquely positioned to drive the acceptance of the Internet for electronic financial data exchange. Intuit will begin working immediately with financial services providers wishing to establish direct Internet links to Intuit products, beginning with its flagship personal finance software, Quicken.  Intuit expects to implement Internet connections for online investment activities in the spring of 1997, and for online banking and bill payment activities in the fall of 1997.  </p>
<p>Intuit's products include the world's leading personal finance, financial planning, expense reporting, tax preparation, small business accounting, payroll and legal software.  Intuit also operates the leading Web site for mutual fund investing, NETworth (http://www.networth.com), and the leading Web site for personal insurance information and purchasing, Quicken InsureMarket (http://www.insuremarket.com).</p>
<p>In addition to 12 million customers of Intuit products around the world, more than 70 mutual fund companies are active in NETworth, five of the world's largest insurance companies have announced support for Quicken InsureMarket and 35 of the nation's leading banks and brokerage firms deliver online banking and bill payment services to Quicken customers today. OpenExchange Framework Will be Published This Year</p>
<p>Working with technology partners, processing companies and financial services providers, Intuit will publish the initial components of its OpenExchange framework by year-end 1996.</p>
<p>OpenExchange is unique in that it will facilitate Internet connections to the full range of financial services providers and organizations critical to the major financial decisions individuals and small businesses must make every day -- including banks, brokerage firms, mutual fund and insurance companies, financial advisors, billers, merchants and government agencies.  While OpenExchange will build on existing specifications for electronic financial data exchange, it differs from them in that it goes beyond online banking and bill payment transactions to encompass a wide range of financial industries and interactions.  This is an important distinction because it allows customers to automate the full range of their financial interactions for greater efficiency and control. ISC/CheckFree Deal Bolsters Internet Commitment</p>
<p>Intuit's decision to swap its back-end bill payment processing subsidiary for an equity position in CheckFree is a related action designed both to leverage a two-year-old investment that ignited consumer usage of online banking and bill payment services and to provide more choice for financial services providers.  By decoupling Intuit's front-end software and Web-based services with its private back-end processing network, financial services providers can choose from a variety of processing options, including the Internet.</p>
<p>In exchange for ISC, Intuit will receive 12.6 million shares of CheckFree common stock -- about 23 percent of the resulting 54 million outstanding shares.  Based on Friday's closing price of 18 1/16 for CheckFree stock, the transaction is valued at $227.6 million.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition to giving our financial services provider customers more choice, our decisions to open our products to direct Internet links and to sell ISC in exchange for an equity stake in CheckFree creates more opportunity for Intuit as well,&quot; said Cook.  &quot;We are now free to pursue new software and Internet businesses while continuing to participate in the bill payment processing business, creating benefit to both Intuit and our full range of customers.&quot;</p>
<p>Intuit Inc., a financial software and Web-based services company, develops and markets Quicken, the leading personal finance software; TurboTax, the best-selling tax preparation software; and QuickBooks, the most popular small business accounting software.  Intuit's Quicken Financial Network (http://www.qfn.com) offers a variety of news, information and market spaces including the No. 1 mutual fund Web site, NETworth.com, and the most dynamic personal insurance Web site, Quicken InsureMarket.com.  Intuit's products and services enable individuals, small businesses and financial professionals to better manage their financial lives and businesses.  In addition, Intuit's systems and solutions provide many of the nation's leading financial service providers with communication, sales and marketing opportunities that deliver new customers, better serve existing customers and lower costs. -0-</p>
