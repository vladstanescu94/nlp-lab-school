<p>Borland International Inc CEO Delbert Yocam said Wednesday Microsoft Corp's practice of recruiting Borland employees are meant to destroy Borland as it tries to execute a turnaround.</p>
<p>&quot;We must stop the predatory business practices of Microsoft, which is hellbent on destroying our company,&quot; Yocam told reporters in a conference call. &quot;This has got to stop.&quot;</p>
<p>Yocam said Microsoft offered &quot;lavish signing bonsuses&quot; in the millions of dollars to lure Borland employees in a &quot;systematic raiding.&quot; Borland earlier filed a lawsuit seeking unspecified monetary damages and an end to the practice.  </p>
<p>Yocam said he wrote to Microsoft co-founder and CEO Bill Gates to demand an end to the alleged raiding practices, but previous repeated requests had not succeeded.</p>
<p>&quot;They are using our employees as a competitive weapon against us and it has got to stop,&quot; Yocam added.</p>
<p>Yocam said 34 top software architects, engineers and marketing managers left Borland for Microsoft in the last 30 months and that, since he took over in December, a dozen had been lured away.  </p>
<p>&quot;In the last two months it's been three to four of those (defections) and it's continuing at an insidious rate,&quot; he said. &quot;They (Microsoft) have paid lavish signing bonuses in the millions of dollars to lure some of these employees away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I just want Microsoft to leave us alone. It's like you're in the desert and Microsoft's stealing your water bottle.&quot;</p>
<p>Borland last week reported a net loss of $108 million, or $2.96 a share, for its fiscal year ended March 31. It has pared its workforce to 800 or so from more than 2,000 at its peak and has said it is in a good position to achieve profits in fiscal 1998 if it can execute its strategy.  </p>
<p>Microsoft lawyers were not immediately available for comment on the lawsuit, which Borland said was filed in a California Superior Court in San Jose at midday Wednesday, hours after the company originally said it had been filed.</p>
<p>One industry source said Microsoft representatives recently gloated about the number of Borland people who defected to Microsoft. Borland said in its lawsuit that many of these participated in a so-called &quot;Dead Borlanders Society.&quot;</p>
<p>The lawsuit said the &quot;society&quot; had participated in a systematic effort to lure away former colleagues, but Borland added that it was not acting against any individuals.  </p>
<p>Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said the company hired more than 2,000 people in the last nine months and currently has more than 2,000 open positions to be filled. He said new recruits are advised not to use confidential information.</p>
<p>&quot;We recruit actively, but are responsible,&quot; he said. &quot;We make very clear that we don't need and don't want any other information from their previous employer.&quot;</p>
<p>Microsoft currently employs more than 20,000 people.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Microsoft had not had an opportunity to review the lawsuit, but &quot;based on their press releases, we believe their claims are completely without merit.&quot;  </p>
<p>Borland said many former employees now hold strategic positions at Microsoft that mirror their roles at Borland. One key software architect was paid $3 million in signing bonuses to join Microsoft last fall, it added.</p>
<p>&quot;Microsoft has 50 to 60 percent market share in this development tools arena. We have 20 percent plus, maybe. It's a monopolistic position (for Microsoft) and they're using all kinds of strategies that are unfair competition,&quot; said Yocam.</p>
<p>Borland's stock, which has traded in a range of 4-3/4 to 17-1/8 in the last year, closed off 3/16 at 6-11/16. Shares of Microsoft closed down 1-13/16 at 115-1/2.</p>
