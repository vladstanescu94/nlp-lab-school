<p>Talks between Apple Computer Inc and Microsoft Corp to form an alliance between the erstwhile enemies were deadlocked until Steve Jobs jumped in about four weeks ago, company officials said Wednesday.</p>
<p>With the sudden departure of Apple Chief Executive Gil Amelio last month, Apple co-founder Jobs assumed an advisory role and kick-started the talks which culminated in Wednesday's unusual deal, Apple Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson told reporters.  </p>
<p>&quot;We've been having discussions over the last nine months with Microsoft. Those negotiations were stalled, and they heated up when Steve got involved about four weeks ago,&quot; he said. &quot;The deal came together after Steve came into the picture.&quot;</p>
<p>Jobs and Microsoft Chief Executive Bill Gates had a few &quot;personal conversations&quot; and both companies agreed it was in their best interests to end their long-running patent dispute and reach a business agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;Both companies really believe it is in their best interests to collaborate,&quot; he told reporters at the Macworld Expo in Boston.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a very tough negotiation,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;Anybody who has ever negotiated with Microsoft before knows they are tough businessmen.&quot;</p>
<p>Negotiations continued late Tuesday and the deal was not signed until early Wednesday, before Jobs delivered the news in his keynote address to surprised Macintosh fans at the trade show, said Apple executive vice president of marketing Guerrino De Luca.</p>
<p>&quot;It was signed very, very recently,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Microsoft will buy $150 million of Apple's stock, which will be issued in preferred, non-voting shares. Microsoft will continue to develop and ship future versions of its popular Microsoft Office suite for the Mac. Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser software will be installed as the default Internet browser on the Macintosh. The two companies also signed a cross-licensing patent agreement giving them access to each other's technology.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a license to develop products that draw upon technologies that might be covered by their patent portfolio and vice versa, without any further royalties beyond what this agreement says,&quot; he said.</p>
