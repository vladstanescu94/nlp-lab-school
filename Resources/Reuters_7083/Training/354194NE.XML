<p>For years Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates and other executives have watched with mixed feelings as longtime rival Apple Computer Inc. has slowly self-destructed.</p>
<p>While the two companies have had frequent clashes over the years, including a landmark copyright lawsuit that went to the Supreme Court, Microsoft also has become the largest independent producer of software for the Macintosh platform.</p>
<p>But as Apple goes through yet another reorganization aimed at stanching losses and regaining lost market share, Microsoft has long since turned its attention to other, more pressing rivalries.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very interested in continuing to work with Apple as we have done through history,&quot; Gates said in Frankfurt, Germany, where he appeared for a product launch. &quot;But I am confused by the Apple operating system strategy ... and have decided not to worry about the future (in this respect).&quot;</p>
<p>Indeed, Microsoft has little need to worry about Apple, which just a few years ago provided the only credible threat to the hegemony of Microsoft's Windows operating system, the software that runs a personal computer.</p>
<p>Now, various versions of Windows are installed on about 80 percent of new desktop copmputers, compared with about 5 percent for the ailing Apple Macintosh operating system.</p>
<p>More importantly, the competitive landscape has been shifting rapidly due to the rise of the Internet and the Java programming language, which is independent of any operating system.</p>
<p>&quot;The Mac operating system vs. the Windows operating system is almost a sideshow nowadays,&quot; said Dwight Davis, editor of Windows Watcher, an industry newsletter. &quot;In centre stage is Java, which has huge momentum and a lot of companies supporting it.&quot;</p>
<p>Both Microsoft and Apple have been trying to &quot;pigeonhole&quot; Java as simply one of many development languages with little success, Davis said.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that Java's on everybody's lips, there's really a critical mass of vendors out there, many of them driven by an anti-Microsoft agenda, and they're going to use Java as their rallying cry to erode Microsoft's dominance in the industry,&quot; Davis said.</p>
<p>As for Microsoft's Macintosh software, at an estimated $250 million a year it would be a huge business for almost any computer software company -- but now represents just 2.5 percent of the Redmond, Wash.-based company's annual revenues.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, last month Microsoft signalled its commitment to the Macintosh platform by forming a product unit with 100 employees dedicated to designing a new version of its Office software bundle for Apple computers, expected out sometime in the fall.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, Gates visited Apple's Cupertino, Calif., headquarters to meet with Chairman Gilbert Amelio and Apple co-founder Steven Jobs and discuss closer cooperation, according to published reports.</p>
<p>Gates confirmed meeting with Jobs but said he was not devoting a lot of time to Apple.</p>
<p>&quot;People like Apple and would like them to succeed,&quot; Gates said. &quot;But that doesn't mean they will succeed.&quot;</p>
<p>Dave Meltzer, Microsoft group product manager for Macintosh applications, estimated that 8 million Macintosh users have at least one Microsoft product, creating steady demand for upgrades.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to sell more units than ever,&quot; Meltzer said.</p>
<p>&quot;To the extent they they're experiencing difficulties, that's a sad thing for us,&quot; he said. &quot;We're certainly confident they will take the right steps to put the company on an even footing.&quot;</p>
