<p>Amazon.com Inc., an online bookseller, is one of the best-known retailers on the Internet but faces a harsh investment climate and tough competition as it plunges into the stock market, industry analysts said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The rapidly growing Seattle-based company filed documents on Monday to sell about 10 percent of the company in an offering projected to raise up to $33 million.</p>
<p>That gives the company a market value of about $300 million despite a reported net loss of $5.8 million last year on sales of only $15.7 million.</p>
<p>While Amazon.com long has been considered a likely candidate for a public offering, some analysts were surprised by the timing, noting that technology stocks in general and Internet startups in particular have been hammered in recent months.</p>
<p>Some analysts speculated that Amazon.com decided to jump in now because of rising competition from bookselling giants Borders Group Inc. and Barnes &amp; Noble Inc., among others.</p>
<p>&quot;I certainly think it's possible it came sooner rather than later because of the entry of those other players into that market,&quot; said Scott Smith, director of the digital commerce group at Jupiter Communications.</p>
<p>The competition already has sparked a price war, forcing Amazon.com to offer its 500 top titles at a 40 percent discount to list price, slashing its slim profit margins.</p>
<p>Smith and other analysts give Amazon.com high marks for identifying and exploiting a niche that seems particularly appropriate for online commerce.</p>
<p>&quot;They can definitely make money at this,&quot; said Bill Bass, an analyst with Forrester Research. &quot;The interesting thing will be to see how much of the market they'll be able to capture.&quot;</p>
<p>Amazon.com advertises itself as &quot;Earth's Largest Bookstore&quot; with an &quot;inventory&quot; of virtually all 1.5 million English-language books in print plus about 1 million out-of-print books, compared with about 200,000 titles at a typical superstore.</p>
<p>In fact Amazon.com keeps no more than a few thousand books on hand at its Seattle warehouse at any time, relying on its relationships with major distributors and publishers to order titles as needed and keep overhead low.</p>
<p>Jeff Bezos, the 33-year-old founder and chief executive of Amazon.com, said the secret to the company's success was its ability to develop strong relationships with customers.</p>
<p>&quot;We are incredibly customer-obsessed,&quot; Bezos said Tuesday at PC Forum, a high-level industry conference in Tucson, Ariz.</p>
<p>&quot;The Web is really primitive at this point,&quot; he said. &quot;You have to make every customer an evangelist.&quot;</p>
<p>The company's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said repeat customers account for more than 40 percent of its business.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's absolutely possible to make money on the Web,&quot; Bezos said, while declining to comment specifically on the company's financial results. &quot;You can sell products at lower prices and have higher margins with much lower overhead.&quot;</p>
<p>But Manesh Shah, publisher of IPO Maven, said the market has not been kind to Internet stocks since last summer, when momentum began shifting to large-capitalization issues.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has been very negative on small-cap IPOs,&quot; he said. &quot;I think they are hoping sometime between now and the end of the summer they get a window to get in.&quot;</p>
<p>Well-known Internet startups such as CNET Inc. and Yahoo Inc. have swung wildly, while Wired Ventures was forced to withdraw its planned offering due to a lack of interest.</p>
<p>Yahoo, which has never matched its peak of $43 a share attained on its first day of trading last year, currently trades around $28. CNET has fallen from as high as $35.75 this year to $24.50 Tuesday.</p>
<p>Even mighty Microsoft Corp. has seen its stock price slip 12 percent in recent weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall the sentiment is quite negative,&quot; Shah said.</p>
