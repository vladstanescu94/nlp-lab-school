<p>Microsoft Corp., with more than $9 billion in cash in the bank and a growing appetite for acquisitions, is an alluring potential suitor for digital entrepreneurs -- but they also fear the software giant's immense power.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a big admirer of Microsoft and I think only damn fools stand in front of oncoming trains,&quot; high-profile venture capital investor John Doerr told a conference in Monterey Tuesday.</p>
<p>Executives attending Herring Communications Inc.'s Venture Markets West conference said fledgling start-up companies have to weigh the benefits of a big investment or a buyout by Microsoft against the fear that the world's biggest software company could easily challenge them head-on.</p>
<p>In a question-and-answer session with Greg Maffei, Microsoft's vice president of corporate development and treasurer, one entrepreneur expressed another concern: that a start-up could approach Microsoft about an investment, only to have its ideas stolen and be driven out of business by the Redmond, Wash., company.</p>
<p>The entrepreneur asked whether Microsoft had erected a so-called Chinese Wall to keep information from moving between its business development group, which evaluates potential deals, and Microsoft product units.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there's an explicit Chinese Wall,&quot; replied Maffei, adding that Microsoft draws on its product units to help evaluate potential investments and partnerships.</p>
<p>&quot;To my knowledge, we've never been sued or even accused of stealing something that came across the transom as an investment opportunity,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Maffei, who held private meetings at the conference with venture capital investors and with the management of at least two potential investment targets, said Microsoft is seeking to invest in growth companies: start-ups looking for capital to help them expand rapidly.</p>
<p>Two dozen of the roughly 60 companies making presentations at the two-day conference are growth companies.</p>
<p>Maffei also said Microsoft has one deal in the bag this year -- whose value he put at less than $50 million -- which it has not yet made public. But he declined to specify the size or extent of future deals that may be in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Maffei noted that most of the company's $2 billion in deals over the past 3-1/2 years has taken place in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it means we're willing to probably do bigger deals. We have been doing bigger deals and we've felt more comfortable,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>This spring, for example, Microsoft agreed to spend $425 million, mostly in stock, to acquire WebTV Networks, a Palo Alto, Calif., start-up which last fall began selling Internet services via television set-top boxes.</p>
<p>However, Maffei said Microsoft was cautious about placing too much emphasis on acquisitions. &quot;Integrating technologies is hard. That's why we don't do a lot of acquisitions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Maffei said there was no shortage of cash for technology investing, noting that many venture capital funds were flush with cash.</p>
<p>He also noted that Microsoft has a stockpile of 250 million stock options with a potential value of more than $20 billion. &quot;I think there's plenty uses for our cash,&quot; the executive said.</p>
<p>Smaller companies have long been wary of dealing with Microsoft, which supplies the operating systems -- the software that runs a personal computer -- for about 90 percent of PCs.</p>
<p>Maffei said Microsoft will concentrate its investments on its core, high-volume businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not going to be involved in selling software that tracks dental records,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But conference participants were not reassured. Following Maffei's comments, one venture fund investor said, &quot;Companies that sell any kind of software that can be included in the (Microsoft) operating system -- watch out.&quot;</p>
<p>One company which struck a deal with Microsoft and then completely revised its business to keep out of Microsoft's way is Spyglass Inc., whose browser technology was folded into Microsoft Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we're water-skiing behind Microsoft,&quot; a Spyglass executive said recently. &quot;It's really easy to get wet.&quot;</p>
