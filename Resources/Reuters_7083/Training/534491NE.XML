<headline>Computer Associates rises on earnings outlook.</headline>
<dateline>ISLANDIA, N.Y. 1997-04-24</dateline>

<p>Shares of Computer Associates International Inc jumped as much as 14 percent Thursday after the software company said its fourth-quarter earnings likely will be better than Wall Street expected.</p>
<p>Computer Associates, the biggest developer of corporate software, also told investors that its European operations -- the cause of a shortfall last quarter -- have been improved.</p>
<p>Shares of Computer Associates, based in Islandia, New York, rose 3-7/8 to 47-7/8.  The stock, which traded as high as 50 earlier, was the most active on the New York Stock Exchange.  </p>
<p>After the market closed Wednesday, CA, the third-biggest U.S. software company, said it expects to report earnings per share of $0.90 for the quarter ended March 31.</p>
<p>Wall Street expected it to earn $0.86 a share, according to an analysts' survey by Zacks Investment Research.</p>
<p>The company also said fourth-quarter revenue will be about $1.2 billion, also better than Wall Street forecasts.</p>
<p>&quot;My expectation, given sales in the pipeline, is that we'll see some pretty bullish quarters to come,&quot; Sanjay Kumar, Computer Associates' president and chief operating officer, said in an interview.  </p>
<p>Computer Associates shares have languished in the past few months because the company had lower-than-expected revenue in the third quarter. It blamed weak sales in Europe.</p>
<p>Kumar said in December that it would take six months for the company to recover.  Computer Associates is now three months into the recovery and doing well, Kumar said Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I cautioned people that we're not out of the wood yet,&quot; he said.  The company still has to improve its European sales through resellers, handle accounts of big customers better and push its computer network management software more aggressively in Europe, he said.</p>
<p>The company specializes in developing software to manage the operations of mainframe computers and huge corporate networks.</p>
<p>The company said revenue for the year ended March 31, 1997, will be slightly over $4 billion, about 15 percent higher than the previous year.</p>
