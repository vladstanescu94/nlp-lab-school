<p>NOTE:  Loss for the year were $11.2 million included restructuring costs.  This compares to net sales of $61.0 million, and a net loss of $18.3 million, or $1.27 per share, including $26.7 million in non-recurring charges related to acquisitions, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1996.</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997, net sales were $4.3 million, after an increase in the allowance for sales returns of $2.7 million, and the net loss was $19.4 million, or $1.34 per share, including restructuring costs and deferred tax expenses.  This compares to net sales of $16.5 million and net income of $950,000, or $.07 per share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997, $8.1 million, or $.56 of the loss, was attributable to restructuring costs, and an additional $4.0 million, or $.28 of the loss, was attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets.  In comparison to previous fiscal 1997 quarters, the fourth quarter was also negatively impacted by the establishment of a valuation allowance for the full amount of the potential Federal income tax benefit associated with the operating loss for the quarter.  In previous fiscal 1997 quarters, the Federal income tax benefit was recognized, as substantially all of the cumulative operating losses incurred through the third fiscal quarter are expected to be realized through the refund of taxes paid in a prior year.</p>
