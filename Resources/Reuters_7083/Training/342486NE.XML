<p>Video game giant Nintendo Co Ltd, building on the runaway success of its new 64-bit video game player in the U.S. market, is boosting output of the machine ahead of its launch in Europe.</p>
<p>The move, disclosed by managing director Hiroshi Imanishi in an interview with Reuters, comes a week after its arch rival Sega Enterprises Ltd said it would merge with toymaker Bandai Co Ltd to become what it called &quot;a formidable force&quot; in the media entertainment business.</p>
<p>Nintendo at the time dismissed the alliance as posing &quot;no worries&quot; for its own business.</p>
<p>Now Nintendo plans to ratchet up shipments of its Nintendo 64 to a million units a month from 700,000 to meet booming demand in the highly competitive U.S. market and a forthcoming launch in Europe,</p>
<p>The Nintendo 64 has sold like hot cakes since it was introduced in Japan in June last year and in the United States in September, with total shipments reaching 3.99 million units by the end of 1996, of which Japanese shipments were 1.85 million and shipments to the U.S. market were 2.14 million.</p>
<p>Sega's 32-bit Sega Saturn, along with Sony Corp's 32-bit PlayStation, pose its main challenge.</p>
<p>The most popular so far has been PlayStation, which has outsold its 32-bit and 64-bit rivals around the world since its launch in 1994.</p>
<p>The 64-bit machine is smarter and faster, but so far has fewer software games available for it.</p>
<p>In a sign of the feverish competition in the game industry, software maker Enix Corp said this month it would develop the latest version of its best-selling game  &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; for Sony instead of for Nintendo.</p>
<p>Another software maker, Square Co Ltd, said it had revised an older version of its popular &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game to run on the PlayStation.</p>
<p>The game had been developed for Nintendo. Square plans to launch its seventh and the latest version of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; this week and that too will run on the PlayStation.</p>
<p>A Nintendo spokesman said after the Sega-Bandai alliance was announced that Sega's sales mostly came from commercial-use game machines and that it was suffering from lower profits. Bandai mainly focuses on toys, he said.</p>
<p>He said Nintendo expects parent sales of more than 34 billion yen ($278 million) in the year to March 31. It posted parent current profit of 117.13 billion yen ($960 million) on sales of 300.48 billion yen ($2.46 billion) in 1995/96.</p>
<p>Imanishi said Nintendo expected parent current profit to top 90 billion yen ($737 million) in the year to March 31, up five billion yen ($40.9 million) from its previous forecast.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect larger profits thanks to the weak yen,&quot; he said. A weak yen helps exporters by making their products more competitive overseas.</p>
<p>Current profit is pre-tax and includes gains and losses on securities investments and other non-operating activities. ($1=122 yen)</p>
