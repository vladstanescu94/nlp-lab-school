<p>Russian Grand Master Garry Kasparov may have been beaten by a computer this week, but the world chess champion may get a payback on Wednesday if Silicon Graphics Inc. goes through with plans to acquire a computer company he helped found.</p>
<p>Sources close to the situation said Silicon Graphics is close to reaching an agreement to acquire privately held ParaGraph International Inc., with a decision possible as early as Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Founded in 1989 by Kasparov, Stepan Pachikov and a group of prominent Russian scientists, ParaGraph has become a leader in virtual reality and three-dimensional Web tools and software as well as pen-based technologies. Kasparov still holds a stake in ParaGraph, but the company declined to comment on the size of his holdings.</p>
<p>Kasparov became the first world chess champion to lose a match to a computer. Deep Blue, an International Business Machines supercomputer, defeated the Russian grandmaster over six games, winning two, drawing three and losing just once.</p>
<p>A Silicon Graphics spokesman declined comment on the potential acquisition.</p>
<p>ParaGraph executives were engaged in a conference call from their Campbell, Calif., headquarters and were not immediately available to comment, their office said.</p>
<p>Silicon Graphics has been active in the emerging world of creating three-dimensional environments on the Web and has bundled its Cosmo Player virtual reality browser with ParaGraph's Internet3D family of authoring tools.</p>
<p>Industry sources said the combination would be a logical step for Silicon Graphics, which has been a leader in the field of graphics and video production and animation as well as in Internet technology.</p>
<p>&quot;The biggest issue is creating these cool 3D worlds and getting them delivered through the bandwidth constrained network,&quot; said one source familiar with Silicon Graphics' technology.</p>
<p>ParaGraph set out eight years ago to help people build their own worlds, and has since enabled the creation of 3-D Web sites inhabited with digital personalities known as avatars, along with co-authoring the Virtual Reality Modeling Language VRML standards.</p>
<p>The company's ink compression technology, known as Digital Ink, was originally developed for use in pen-based applications like Apple Computer Inc.'s Newton and Microsoft Corp.'s Windows CE.</p>
<p>Paragraph boosts an in-house team of 90 world class scientists, engineers and digital artists.</p>
<p>ParaGraph has projected its revenues will roughly double this year to $12 million. No price for the deal was immediately available, although one source said it will likeley be valued at less than $50 million.</p>
<p>The company has its headquarters in Campbell and maintains research and development facilities both there and in Moscow. ((sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400))</p>
