<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch cable TV networks to start Internet trials.</title>
<headline>Dutch cable TV networks to start Internet trials.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-09-12</dateline>

<p>Two of the largest Dutch cable television operators said on Thursday they would set up trials involving the Internet and Intranets this autumn, joining an international battle to set up the first successful combination.</p>
<p>The largest Dutch network Casema, majority-owned by Dutch PTT, will begin an electronic shopping service in the central Dutch town of Veenendaal, using IBM technology and transaction clearance by banking giant ABN AMRO.</p>
<p>Another cable operator said in June it would soon test providing Internet access on cable.</p>
<p>A2000, based in Amsterdam and owned by Philips / United International Holdings unit UPC and U.S. West, said it and Dutch Internet service provider NLnet would hook up the first houses to their NL2000 venture in November.</p>
<p>&quot;So far, no cable company in the world has been able to successfully put Internet services on cable and roll it out beyond the trial. We're the first Internet service provider involved in a TV cable test. That could well be a critical success factor,&quot; NLnet's managing director Aris Doelman told Reuters.</p>
<p>He reckoned that NLnet's 14 years of Internet experience would help it be the first to overcome initial stumbling blocks.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to start rolling it out in all of Amsterdam halfway through 1997,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Netherlands is the most densely cabled country in the world, with 95 percent of all 6.2 million households connected.</p>
<p>Internet access via TV cables is much faster than telephone cable data traffic, at least twice as quick as standard ISDN data lines. It has the potential to go even faster.</p>
<p>These advantages can only be reaped if the cable network contains no clogs nor bottlenecks, most likely in a separately controlled part of the Internet, known as an Intranet.</p>
<p>The Casema/ABN AMRO/IBM trial in Veenendaal is such an Intranet, the first in the Netherlands to experiment with secure electronic payment and the first in the world to build a shopping mall on the television cable.</p>
<p>The multi-million guilder test will start in spring of next year and involve up to 1,000 families.</p>
<p>ABN AMRO Bank said it intended to become a major player in electronic banking transactions via public networks building on its three years of experience in telephone and PC banking.</p>
<p>&quot;ABN AMRO wants to invest large amounts of money in these new developments,&quot; ABN AMRO's consumer marketing director Peter Heijt said at an Intranet convention in Utrecht.</p>
<p>Consumers in Veenendaal could use ordinary credit card numbers encrypted according to the Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) international protocol developed by IBM, Netscape, Microsoft, Visa and Mastercard and which looks likely to become the world standard for such payments.</p>
<p>ABN AMRO was also looking at smartcard payments via the net, but said proven encryption methods for wiring these payments had not yet been developed, he said.</p>
<p>Mass introduction of smart cards by Dutch banks later this year would therefore remain a seperate development.</p>
<p>&quot;But we're not trying to chase market share on the Internet or Intranet. We're just building experience in as many places as possible, because safe transactions are a bank's core business,&quot; Heijt said.</p>
