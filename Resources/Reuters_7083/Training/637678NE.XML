<p>Netscape Communications Corp on Tuesday said it planned to release the final versions of its Netscape Communicator 4.0 Internet software and SuiteSpot 3.0 server products next week.</p>
<p>Netscape said the release -- timed to coincide with the company's third software developer conference starting in San Jose, Calif., on June 11 -- will be delivered through five of the Internet's most heavily visited World Wide Web sites.</p>
<p>Netscape's promotion includes its own Web site, which has up to 130 million hits a day (corrects to 'hits' from 'visitors'), and search engines operated by Yahoo! Inc., Excite Inc., Infoseek Corp. and Lycos Inc. Search engines are searchable catalogs of the sprawling Web.</p>
<p>The announcement, which also coincides with a keynote address by Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen at the Networld+Interop trade show in Tokyo, demonstrates Netscape's confidence in its ability to deliver the software on time.</p>
<p>&quot;We're shipping next week at the developer conference the most comprehensive software we've shipped yet, in Communicator and SuiteSpot,&quot; said Dave Rothschild, a director of product marketing at Netscape.</p>
<p>&quot;This kind of complex software has a tendency of surprising you at the last minute and not being able to ship, but we're meeting our plans,&quot; Rothschild said.</p>
<p>&quot;In order to manage the demand, we are signing up the search engines to distribute Communicator so we'll have five of the largest sites on the Net. We'll have over 30,000 sites that point to the downloading.&quot;</p>
<p>Netscape says more than 60 million copies of its browser software have been put into use and the trick will be to entice as many users as it can of its earlier versions to upgrade to the new version.</p>
<p>Netscape stock has been in a tug of war over the last several months between Wall Street analysts who disagree as to whether the Mountain View, Calif.-based company can ship the software on schedule.</p>
<p>Late last month, Netscape said it would ship the final releases of Communicator and its server products within 30 days.</p>
<p>Communicator, which has been available in preliminary test, or beta, versions since before Christmas, combines a huge set of new features, including upgraded electronic mail capabilities, collaboration and a &quot;Netcaster&quot; capability which enables users to receive updated information from the Internet.</p>
<p>Versions in nine other languages -- German, French, Japanese, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Danish, Dutch and Korean -- will be available within 30 days, the company said.</p>
<p>Netscape will also ship the final three of its nine products for server, or network, computers -- its messaging, enterprise and Collabra products -- to complete its SuiteSpot 3.0 family.</p>
<p>The Netscape SuiteSpot server will continue to be priced at $4,995. Netscape Communicator Standard Edition costs $59.95 and includes the new Navigator browser plus messaging, collaboration and conferencing.</p>
<p>Netscape Communicator Professional Edition, which adds calendar, administration and connectivity features, will be available for $79.95. The company sells much of its software on a yearly subscription basis, and subscribers get automatic updates.</p>
<p>Rothschild said the company hopes within 30 days to double the list of 100 major customers it recently said are each committed to deploying Netscape to more than 500 of its employees' computers.</p>
<p>The company also aims to ship about a million server packages in the first six months of 1997, as many as it shipped for all of 1996, according to sources familiar with Netscape's marketing plans.</p>
<p>The company would not confirm the target.</p>
<p>Analysts said Netscape is launching a broader marketing initiative than before to take advantage of what it hopes will be a five- or six-month lead over archrival Microsoft Corp. in the market for Internet software.</p>
<p>Microsoft, which is working on an Internet Explorer 4.0 version due out in the summer, will have the advantage that it is committed to offering its browser for free, although for corporate users Netscape's browser is heavily discounted.</p>
