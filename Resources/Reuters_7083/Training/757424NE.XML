<p>Microsoft Corp. plans to increase significantly spending on sales, marketing and development over the coming year, a move that could crimp earnings growth for the software giant until two major new products are launched in 1998.</p>
<p>At their annual meeting with financial analysts, Microsoft executives issued their typical cautionary comments about challenges ahead, reiterating that they expect revenue growth to slow in the fiscal year that just began due to tough comparisons, a lack of new products and saturation.</p>
<p>&quot;In the long term I love our company,&quot; Executive Vice President Steve Ballmer said. &quot;But I think there are a lot of challenges. I think people recognise the upside potential, but I don't think there's a lot of recognition of the challenges that face us.&quot;</p>
<p>Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Gates also made cautionary remarks, particularly about growth in the company's research and development spending and the challenge posed by some $26 billion in outstanding employee stock options.</p>
<p>But Gates was optimistic about the prospect of driving sales of the company's high-end Windows NT products into large and small businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;Eventually we see even the consumer part of the market served by flavors of NT,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Microsoft sales and marketing expenses have declined over the past two years from 31.9 percent of revenues in fiscal 1995 to 25.2 percent in the year that ended June 30, as the company has leveraged sharply rising sales and cut operating costs drastically.</p>
<p>But executives said that trend would be reversed over the coming year as growth slows and the company builds new sales organisations to target business customers.</p>
<p>For example, Chief Operating Officer Bob Herbold said marketing expenses would rise beyond last year's level of 9.5 percent of its $11.4 billion in net revenues, and product support costs could rise &quot;significantly&quot; above last year's 3.3 percent of revenues.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to have to spend some money next year,&quot; he said. &quot;That's going to drive those numbers up a bit.&quot;</p>
<p>Microsoft also plans to boost research and development spending to $2.6 billion in fiscal 1998 from $2.2 billion in the fiscal year that ended in June.</p>
<p>News of the higher spending plans, coupled with forecasts of slower revenue growth, sent Microsoft shares on a wild ride Thursday with the stock dropping to $135.625 before recovering to $138, down $3.4375 on the day.</p>
<p>Microsoft is planning upgrades to both its Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems in the coming year, but revenue growth is expected to slow to 20 to 25 percent from last year's 31 percent rate, according to analysts.</p>
<p>Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Greg Maffei said he expected the dollar to continue to rise in fiscal 1998, reducing total revenues by about 5 percent.  He also said Microsoft executives did not expect next year's Windows 98 upgrade to be anywhere near the blockbuster product that its predecessor Windows 95 was.</p>
<p>Maffei expects Microsoft to resume repurchasing stock in fiscal 1998 but said: &quot;I do not know and I will not say at what price.&quot;</p>
<p>Microsoft did not repurchase stock in the fourth quarter because company executives felt the price had risen too high.</p>
<p>Group Vice President Pete Higgins said Microsoft would lose &quot;hundreds of millions&quot; of dollars on its interactive media ventures in the coming year, but he said losses are declining.</p>
<p>He said the company is &quot;tightening the screws&quot; to keep costs down, but he was confident the company was in all the right areas with its Microsoft Network online service, Sidewalk local entertainment product and Web sites focusing on travel, investment, autos and gaming.</p>
<p>Higgins said MSN, the No. 2 on-line service behind America Online Inc., has more than 2.3 million subscribers, and the company's MSNBC news joint venture has more than 1.2 million unique users each month.</p>
<p>Ballmer said the company would stick with the interactive businesses even though they may continue to lose money through fiscal 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;If we do it right we'll figure out how to make money over time,&quot; Ballmer told reporters outside the meeting.</p>
<p>Ballmer also said Internet Explorer version 4.0 was on track for final release in September.</p>
