<headline>RESEARCH ALERT - Oracle cut to hold.</headline>
<text>
<p>-- UBS Securities said analyst Joseph Farley reduced the rating on Oracle Corp to hold from strong buy.</p>
<p>-- Shares fell 3-1/4 to 36-1/2.  </p>
<p>-- Volume was heavy at 14.2  million shares.</p>
<p>-- The analyst also cut his earnings estimates for the year ending May 1997 to $1.25 per share from $1.30 and for fiscal 1998 to $1.58 from $1.70 per share.</p>
<p>-- &quot;We are unable to apply a degree of certainty to (third quarter) results,&quot; Farley wrote in published comments, referring to the quarter ended February 28.</p>
<p>-- He said Oracle's results could be hurt by &quot;ongoing troubles in Europe&quot; and the &quot;possibility of lackluster growth&quot; in the United States, which might otherwise be counted on to produce an upside to overall earnings results.  </p>
<p>-- Analyst said Oracle was nearing the &quot;inherent limits in (its) its business model and that its revenues included an increasing contribution from lower margin businessess.</p>
<p>-- Analyst is cautious on his outlook for Oracle's application, database and tool markets.</p>
<p>-- Farley wrote that the June release of the next major release of its core database management system, Oracle 8, heightened the near-term risk to revenues of a product transition making him &quot;even more cautious.&quot;</p>
<p>-- While farther out on the horizon, the analyst noted that new releases of Microsoft's SQL Server database system could, in time, challenge Oracle's core business.</p>
<p>-- He said the company's move to target vertical markets like energy and telecommuncations, while a legitimate strategy, ads further risk at a time of other transitions.</p>
