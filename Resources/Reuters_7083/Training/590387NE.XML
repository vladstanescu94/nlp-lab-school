<p>An Illinois man has been arrested and charged with threatening to kill Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates in a $5 million extortion plot, authorities said on Friday.</p>
<p>Adam Pletcher was arrested on May 9 in the Chicago suburb of Long Grove, where he lives with his parents, and charged with extortion, federal prosecutors said. He was freed on $100,000 bond and is due to appear in U.S. District Court in Seattle on Thursday for arraignment.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Pletcher sent four letters to Gates, beginning in March, threatening to kill the software company founder and his wife, Melinda, unless payment of at least $5 million was made.</p>
<p>The first letter was intercepted at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Washington, by corporate security officers, who contacted the FBI.</p>
<p>Agents then used an America Online dating service specified by the author of the letters to track down Pletcher, described as a loner in his early 20s who spends much of his time in front of the computer.</p>
<p>Authorities said they treated the threats seriously but did not believe Gates' life was ever in danger.</p>
<p>&quot;We generally think this was a kid with a rich fantasy life, just living that out,&quot; said Tom Ziemba, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Katrina Pflaumer.</p>
<p>&quot;This was handled in a fairly routine fashion by Microsoft security and law enforcement agencies,&quot; Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said. &quot;At some point in the investigation Microsoft did make Bill aware of the situation.&quot;</p>
<p>Pletcher's online activities have landed him in trouble before.</p>
<p>In February the Illinois attorney general sued Pletcher, accusing him of defrauding consumers of thousands of dollars in an alleged Internet scam, according to a story in the Chicago Tribune. Several consumers complained they sent Pletcher up to $5,500 to find them a car deal and never got their money back.</p>
<p>Despite his status as richest man in America, with a Microsoft stake valued at more than $30 billion, Gates is still known to travel alone on regularly scheduled flights. But Murray said the executive was well-protected.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't comment at all on Bill's security other than to say that there are extensive and appropriate security measures in place for Bill, for his family and for Microsoft facilities and personnel,&quot; Murray said.</p>
