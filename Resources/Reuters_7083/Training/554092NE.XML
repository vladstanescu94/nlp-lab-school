<p>ForeFront Thursday said its largest shareholder had signed an agreement to limit the number of shares he would sell this year.</p>
<p>The computer software applications company said the agreement was designed to provide the investment community with greater predictability of the intentions its largest stockholder, Michael Kaplan. Under terms of the agreement Kaplan said he would sell no shares of ForeFront stock between May 1 and August 1. Through December 31 he would sell no more than 200,000 shares.</p>
<p>Kaplan is the founder of AllMicro, Inc., which is now known as ForeFront Direct. AllMicro was acquired by ForeFront in July 1996 for 1.05 million shares of ForeFront stock in a transaction that was accounted for as a pooling of interests.</p>
<p>The Clearwater, Fla.-based software telemarketing operation has had an annual growth rate exceeding 35 percent and was named to Inc. magazine's list of fastest-growing, privately-held companies.</p>
<p>&quot;Looking at ForeFront's accomplishments to date and our solid strategy for achieving profitability this year, I believe that ForeFront stock is significantly undervalued,&quot; said Kaplan.</p>
