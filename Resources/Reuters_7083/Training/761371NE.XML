<title>SINGAPORE: Creative selling overdone - Barings.</title>

<p>Selling in Creative Technology over the last couple of weeks has been overdone, ING-Baring Securities said on Monday.</p>
<p>The broking house also reiterated its buy recommendation on the company, which is due to release its 1996/1997 results later in day.</p>
<p>Nervous investors unloaded Creative shares on Friday and continued to do so on Monday because of a perceived negative impact on market share and future earnings by Venture Manufacturing's new multi-media software, NovaStation.</p>
<p>At 0825 GMT, Creative shares were down 90 cents to S$33.60.  </p>
<p>Barings said Creative shares had appreciated sharply in recent weeks so it was natural for some profit taking to occur, but &quot;the selling was overdone&quot;.</p>
<p>It said the companies had different marketing strategies, with Creative targetting the retail sector, from which it derives 80 percent of its revenue.</p>
<p>Venture's target is the original equipment manufacturer.</p>
<p>Barings also said Creative had a very strong brand name for its sound card business in the retail sector whereas Venture had yet to establish one.  </p>
<p>&quot;The sound card market will not become extinct because of the introduction of this (NovaStation) software...In the meantime, sound cards will continue to evolve as they have in the past five years with the introduction of better technologies,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Barings said the outlook for Creative in the next six months was still good and there should be good momentum going into the Christmas season. &quot;Our supplier sources in the industry also indicate strong order books from Creative,&quot; it said.</p>
