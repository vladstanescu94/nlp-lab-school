<p>Now that Microsoft Corp. dominates the world's desktop computers with its operating systems and applications, the software giant is aiming higher.</p>
<p>In its latest assault on the back office doors of the corporate world, Microsoft wants to prove that its high-end Windows NT operating system can handle the largest and most complex business tasks.</p>
<p>Just two years ago many technology executives would have scoffed at the notion that personal computers running Windows NT, launched in 1993, could replace IBM mainframes or minicomputers using the well-proven Unix operating system.</p>
<p>To be sure executives of Microsoft rivals like Sun Microsystems Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. still belittle the system as a mere &quot;print and file&quot; engine -- good enough for small networks but far too weak to support critical business applications.</p>
<p>&quot;We certainly see there are some applications that will run on NT,&quot; said Mark Canepa, vice president and general manager of Sun's workgroup server division. &quot;The question is what will happen when this operating system gets positioned for applications that are beyond its capability?&quot;</p>
<p>But sales of NT and related Microsoft software have soared since version 4.0 of the operating system was launched last summer, making it impossible for Microsoft rivals to ignore.</p>
<p>The product will take center stage Tuesday when the Redmond, Wash.-based company rolls out its marketing juggernaut led by Chairman Bill Gates at a heavily promoted midtown Manhattan media event that will emphasize the importance of Windows NT in Microsoft's growth strategy.</p>
<p>Microsoft's so-called &quot;Scalability Day&quot; is intended to showcase the ability of NT to handle the huge transaction volumes needed for large-scale business applications such as data warehousing and transaction processing.</p>
<p>Microsoft is expected to demonstrate its &quot;Wolfpack&quot; technology that will allow several servers -- computers that manage networks -- to be linked together to share workloads and allow &quot;failsafe&quot; operations.</p>
<p>Analysts said it will be years before NT reaches parity with costlier rival Unix systems, but the gap is narrowing.</p>
<p>&quot;It's definitely not at the enterprise class level of a large Unix system like Sun, but it is a little bit larger than most people believe,&quot; said Scott Winkler, an analyst at Gartner Group.</p>
<p>Microsoft's core business of desktop computer systems and applications is hardly in bad shape, but executives of the software company have warned for years of a potential growth slowdown as the market matures.</p>
<p>As a result Microsoft has focused intensely on the opportunity in network servers, a $60 billion market growing rapidly as corporations link to the Internet and install private intranets -- internal networks modeled on the Internet.</p>
<p>Sales of server systems and applications led by NT have become Microsoft's fastest-growing business, accounting for a projected $2 billion of the company's $11.4 billion in revenues in the current fiscal year, up from an estimated $800 million last year, said analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie.</p>
<p>He said the NT focus was &quot;part of the company's overall strategy to take Windows and push it all the way up the organization and all the way down the organization.&quot;</p>
<p>While Microsoft is selling Windows NT at the high-end, it is developing a myriad of new low-end Windows versions for wallet-size computers, television set-top boxes and other consumer devices.</p>
<p>Microsoft has a built-in disadvantage when it comes calling on corporations. Unlike hardware vendors like IBM and Sun that can offer one-stop shopping including software and support, Microsoft must rely on third-party vendors.</p>
<p>But the growing popularity of NT has drawn many high-end hardware vendors more tightly into the Microsoft fold, including Hewlett-Packard Co., Digital Equipment Corp. and Tandem Computers Inc., all of which are expected to demonstrate NT-based systems at the Microsoft event.</p>
