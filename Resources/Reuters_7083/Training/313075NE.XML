<title>USA: Microsoft unveils new version of Office.</title>

<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>Microsoft Corp. Thursday unveiled the much-anticipated version of its next-generation software for office computers, called Office 97.</p>
<p>Office 97, a suite of software that includes popular programmes such as Microsoft Word, Excel, Access and PowerPoint, has many new features, such as Internet integration and document collaboration.</p>
<p>The software giant, which currently has 55 million users of Microsoft Office applications, said it had already received advance orders from the nearly 10,000 retail outlets for Office 97. The software became available in stores Thursday.</p>
<p>The company said 3 million copies had been sold through corporate licensing agreements.</p>
<p>However, industry analysts noted that many large business users of Microsoft's Office software have not upgraded to the Windows 95 or Windows NT operating systems, which are required to use Office 97.</p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., said that more than 80 percent of the improvements in Office were a result of customer feedback.</p>
<p>&quot;Our investments in understanding the needs of customers and our continued ability to deliver exciting enhacements are the cornerstone of Office's ongoing success,&quot; Chairman and CEO Bill Gates said.</p>
<p>Gates launched the software at a media event on the stage of New York's Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Centre.</p>
<p>Microsoft dominates the office suite category of software applications, with a 90 percent market share, according to International Data Corp., a market research firm based in Framingham, Mass.</p>
<p>But it faces increasingly aggressive competition from Canada's Corel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus unit.</p>
<p>Corel, which uses WordPerfect word-processing software as the core of its office software, made a significant dent in Microsoft's retail market share in the second half of last year, according to industry analysts.</p>
<p>Office is a huge cash generator for the software giant, and its entire desktop applications group, including Office, is expected to bring in about $5 billion of its fiscal 1997 revenues, which are estimated at slightly over $10 billion.</p>
<p>One new component in Office 97 is called Microsoft Outlook, a desktop information manager. Outlook helps users manage information, track documents and communicate with others.</p>
<p>By integrating e-mail, scheduling, contact management, task management and a module for tracking documents and events, Outlook acts as a central &quot;hub&quot; for Office 97, the company said.</p>
<p>Other features include Internet technologies that make it easy for users to create &quot;hyperlinks&quot; linking their documents to a World Wide Web site, for example.</p>
<p>Microsoft's stock gained $1.125 to $85.75 in early trading on Nasdaq.</p>
