<headline>Netscape shares tumble after analyst's downgrade.</headline>
<dateline>PALO ALTO, Calif. 1997-01-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares of Netscape Communications Corp. plummeted on Wednesday, shedding more than 18 percent of their value after a Wall Street analyst lowered his rating, citing factors he said clouded the financial picture for the Internet software pioneer.</p>
<p>The shares closed off $10.875 at $47.875 in volume of more than 14 million shares, the third most actively traded share on the Nasdaq market.</p>
<p>Analysts and traders attributed the decline to a research note issued by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Inc. analyst William Gurley saying the stock closed Monday near his price target.</p>
<p>A colleague at Gurley's office said the analyst was not commenting publicly on the research. Traders said he downgraded the stock to an &quot;accumulate&quot; rating from a buy.</p>
<p>The sharp share decline was a further demonstration of investors' jitters over the highly volatile Internet market.</p>
<p>Netscape, which since its high-flying August 1995 initial stock offering has assumed a leadership mantle for the nascent sector, is also in the throes of a shifting strategy.</p>
<p>Since last summer's &quot;browser war&quot; showdown with Microsoft Corp., which has pledged to give away its Internet Explorer software and thereby essentially eliminate the market for Netscape's initial Navigator product, Netscape has overhauled its business plan.</p>
<p>The Mountain View, Calif. company is now concentrated on corporate intranets, or private computer networks that utilize cheaper and more flexible Internet technologies to improve distribution of information to employees and customers.</p>
<p>Just before Christmas, Netscape released a public test version of its new, feature-rich Communicator software.</p>
<p>The preview of the Communicator suite has received solid critical review and Netscape said Wednesday that it had helped boost the number of users of Netscape's electronic mail to 12 million, making it the market's fastest-growing e-mail.</p>
<p>But analysts have raised concerns the new business model requires longer lead-times to produce customer sales and this could provide serious transition challenges.</p>
<p>Gurley's note cited just such &quot;a lengthening sales cycle, a new pricing model and a major product transition,&quot; as being among the reasons for his downgrade, market-makers said.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Netscape said the company had issued no news that would account for the share activity.</p>
<p>Some market sources said another factor in the stock's steep decline was market talk that Chrysler Corp. may have chosen International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus Development Corp unit over Netscape.</p>
<p>But a Chrysler spokeswoman, Lori McTavish, said the carmaker has contracts with both Lotus, for electronic mail, and with Netscape, for its intranet software.</p>
<p>&quot;We have contracts with both Lotus and with Netscape. We have not dropped Netscape for Lotus,&quot; she said.</p>
