<title>USA: Computer Assoc. posts earnings vs. year-ago loss.</title>
<headline>Computer Assoc. posts earnings vs. year-ago loss.</headline>
<dateline>ISLANDIA, N.Y.</dateline>
<text>
<p>Computer Associates International Inc., which agreed last week to buy Cheyenne Software for $1.2 billion, Wednesday reported earnings of $223 million for the latest quarter, compared with a loss a year ago.</p>
<p>The biggest independent maker of software for mainframe computers said the earnings amounted to 59 cents a share for its second quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $637.2 million, or $1.76 a share, in the 1995 quarter.</p>
<p>The year-ago figures included a pretax charge of $1.3 billion related to Computer Associates' $1.8 billion purchase of Legent Corp., another mainframe software company, last year. Excluding the charge, earnings in the 1995 quarter were $170.9 million, or 45 cents a share.</p>
<p>Results for the latest quarter beat expectations on Wall Street, but CA stock sank, apparently on concerns that the Cheyenne acquisition would dilute CA's earnings in the short run.</p>
<p>It fell $2.50 to $63.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Sales grew 22 percent to $990.1 million in the quarter from $812.3 million.</p>
<p>The company cited strength in sales of computer software for businesses, including database management, application development, manufacturing and financial applications.</p>
<p>While CA is a big player in mainframe software, it has been moving aggressively into the business of selling software for corporate networks of personal computers.</p>
<p>The agreement to buy Cheyenne, a maker of data storage, communications and anti-virus software, was a step in that direction, industry analysts said.</p>
<p>While the company said when it announced the Cheyenne acquisition on Oct. 7 that it would not affect earnings, some analysts questioned the deal.</p>
<p>Several analysts said CA might be overpaying, and at least one said the deal was bound to dilute profits because CA would probably have to borrow as much as $1 billion for the purchase, raising interest expense.</p>
