<p>Fidelity Investments behemoth Magellan Fund has been stocking up on big names in the airline, technology, healthcare and retail sectors, even as the overall U.S. stock market has taken a beating in recent weeks, according to Fidelity watchers.</p>
<p>&quot;The strongest sector has been air transport,&quot; said David O'Leary, president of Alpha Equity Research, of Portsmouth, N.H., which tracks Fidelity activity. &quot;We've picked up signals that (Magellan) is continuing to buy technology, healthcare and retail.&quot;  </p>
<p>Robert Stansky, portfolio manager of Magellan, the largest fund in the United States, has been buying UAL Corp, Delta Air Lines, AMR Corp and Continental Airlines Inc, according to O'Leary.</p>
<p>Stansky has also made bets on Microsoft Corp, Intel Corp, Dell Computer Corp, and Cisco Systems Inc.</p>
<p>Between February and April, the S&amp;P 500 index has declined about eight percent, and the drop in some technology issues has been even sharper.  </p>
<p>Among retail stocks, Stansky has bought Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Home Depot Inc, and Lowe's Cos Inc, according to O'Leary.</p>
<p>Recent healthcare purchases include Warner-Lambert Co, and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, as well as Oxford Health Plans Inc and Healthsouth Corp, O'Leary added.</p>
<p>Analysts said the buying spree was consistent with Stansky's long-time devotion to growth stocks. &quot;He's certainly looking for accelerated earnings growth,&quot; said Eric Kobren, president of the Fidelity Insight newsletter.  </p>
<p>Analysts said the asset allocation changes indicate that Stansky is committed to fully investing the fund in stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there's been much of a change in the strategy,&quot; said Eric Kobren, president of Fidelity Insight.</p>
<p>Some analysts criticized Stansky for taking a long time to get rid of the bond holdings. &quot;I'm shocked at how slowly he reacted,&quot; said O'Leary. &quot;Very slowly, like a tortoise.&quot;</p>
<p>But they acknowledged that the transition was complicated because he needed to find stocks to buy with the cash from sale of the bonds.  </p>
<p>Analysts said that while Stansky has steered the fund to growth stocks, investors continued to pull their money out in large chunks -- though at a slower rate.</p>
<p>Kobren estimated that Magellan had net redemptions of $540 million in March compared to $1.2 billion in January redemptions.</p>
<p>O'Leary estimated investors have taken $9 billion out of the fund since Stansky took over last June.</p>
<p>Magellan's net assets dropped to $51.42 billion at March 31 compared to $53.79 billion at February 28.</p>
