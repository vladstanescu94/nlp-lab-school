<p>Computer Concepts Corp said it had sold International Business Machines Corp 50,000 copies of its d.b.Express database mining software for use in IBM's customer support help desk operations.</p>
<p>In addition, a spokesman for Computer Concepts said the company expected to sell an additional 100,000 copies of the data-mining software to IBM in the course of 1997.</p>
<p>Financial terms were not disclosed.</p>
<p>The data-mining software typically sells for $700 a copy at retail, but IBM was offered a volume discount, the spokesman said.  </p>
<p>Greg Garbe, a sales manager in IBM's Northeast district, cautioned that the Computer Concepts estimate of IBM's future d.b.Express purchasing plans may be on the high side.</p>
<p>He said a conservative estimate was that IBM was considering buying another 50,000 copies in 1997, but left open the possibility that the company could pay for up to 100,000 copies in the course of next year.</p>
<p>An IBM corporate spokesman said the company had a policy of not commenting on its future purchasing plans and declined to confirm the projected 1997 orders.  </p>
<p>The d.b.Express software was purchased by IBM's Global Services' NetWork Station (NWS) Delivery Center, Computer Concepts said in a statement.</p>
<p>Under the deal, IBM is authorized to offer d.b.Express software as a service to all its existing NWS corporate customers for creating reports from data residing on IBM mainframes.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect corporate customers will use d.b.Express on a daily reporting basis in addition to using it to browse historical activity,&quot; says Mike Minicozzi, manager of IBM's NetWork Station Management Delivery Organization.  </p>
<p>&quot;It has a wide range of potential applications in the data-rich IBM environment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Using d.b.Express, corporate customers will be able to use raw data to generate their own reports that would otherwise be provided by IBM HelpDesk database personnel.</p>
<p>Dan DelGiorno, the president of Computer Concepts, said that, &quot;The IBM order is just the first in what we expect will be a series of applications, each serving to accommodate different data querying needs in the IBM corporate networks.&quot;</p>
<p>The company described d.b.Express as a non-technical graphical data interface software product that simplifies a computer user's search for specific information from databases large and small by helping users recognize related data.</p>
<p>In mid-afternoon trading Thursday, Computer Concepts was up 3/64 at 21/64 on volume of nearly 2.7 million shares.</p>
