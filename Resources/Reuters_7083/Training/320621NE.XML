<p>Heartsoft Inc said Tuesday net revenues for the six month period increased 20 percent to $661,476, compared with $548,828 for the same period one year ago.</p>
<p>The company posted a net loss of ($103,697), or 2 cents per share,  compared with a profit of $163,120, or 3 cents per share for the  prior year's same period.</p>
<p>&quot;Heartsoft's second fiscal quarter ending September 30, is typically the company's least profitable quarter since most schools  are out during July and part of August.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, intentional expansion of the company's sales infrastructure has resulted in higher operating expenses, and the  addition of third-party products to the sales mix has reduced the  gross margin.  We anticipate measurable improvement in the third  quarter as school purchasing patterns accelerate in the Fall  semester,&quot; said the Company's Chairman, Benjamin P. Shell.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the last 9 months, we have invested heavily in Heartsoft's  internal development capabilities and we are in the beta testing  stage of a proprietary development environment which is allowing the  company to produce quality, multimedia educational titles in an  unprecedented manner simultaneously for Windows 95 and Macintosh  PowerPC,&quot; Shell said.</p>
<p>&quot;The first three titles produced with this authoring system will  center on critical thinking skills and are being developed in  association with the Foundation for Critical Thinking in Sonoma,  California.</p>
<p>We are also anticipating the release of an early learning reading series in August.  These two new lines together, will double the  number of educational titles published by Heartsoft.  1997 is going  to be a great year for the company.&quot;</p>
