<headline>Formulab says NASDAQ listing to go ahead.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-04-09</dateline>

<p>Computer group Formulab Neuronetics Corp Ltd said on Wednesday it would go ahead with a planned listing on the U.S. NASDAQ main board.</p>
<p>Formulab said it had started the registration process and expected to achieve compliance listing on the NASDAQ SmallCap market within six weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;The company expects to be listed on the NASDAQ main board within six months,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>Formulab shares fell more than 30 percent last Friday after it announced that its proposed listing had been delayed.  </p>
<p>The company launched its neural PC, the Richter Paradigm Computer, in the U.S. in December 1996.</p>
<p>The computer was said to be able to process more complex problems than existing personal computers.</p>
<p>Formulab's share price tumbled shortly after the U.S. launch on media reports of a negative reaction to the launch. The shares hit a peak around A$1.52 in December about the time of the U.S. launch.</p>
<p>Formulab said on Wednesday it believed the share price fall was due to a consistent sell down reflecting disillusionment among some shareholders about the NASDAQ postponement.  </p>
<p>It said the changes to its plans had been in response to changes in the U.S. economy and a falling U.S. stock market.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite these changes in U.S. market conditions, the company has the financial resources to proceed with its entry into the U.S. market place and expansion of its U.S. and Australian commercial operations,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Formulab shares closed up 0.5 cents at 20.5 cents.</p>
