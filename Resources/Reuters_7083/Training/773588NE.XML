<headline>PSINet says venture for Europe may not go through.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>PSINet Inc said Thursday that it and  Chatterjee Management Co are not likely reach agreement to go through  with a proposed joint venture that would build an Internet network  across Europe.</p>
<p>PSINet, an Internet service provider, reported the possibility in  a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>It said that for several months, the parties had discussed a substantive  change to a joint venture agreement they entered into on September  last year, which if agreed to, would have led to a direct investment  in the company by Chatterjee.  </p>
<p>The September agreement called for PSINet and an investment group  led by New York-based Chatterjee would establish the joint venture  in which the group would invest $41 million.</p>
<p>&quot;No monies were invested by Chatterjee or the investment group pursuant  to the Joint Venture Agreement nor were there any other actions undertaken  to implement it, PSINet said in the filing.</p>
<p>PSINet said Chatterjee, in a letter on July 14, expressed the conclusion  that PSINet does not intend to proceed with the joint venture agreement  or the substantive change that had been discussed.</p>
<p>If the parties do not complete the transaction, PSINet said the joint  venture agreement may be abandoned or the parties may resort to arbitration.</p>
<p>PSINet said it is also possible that Chatterjee may institute other  legal proceedings seeking to enforce the agreement.</p>
<p>If that should take place, PSINet it would vigorously defend itself.</p>
