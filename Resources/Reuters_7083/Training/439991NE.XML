<p>German phone giant Deutsche Telekom AG on Thursday outlined the details of its online deal with Microsoft Corp. and said it planned to expand high-speed telecommunications networks and improve home banking.</p>
<p>The deal with Microsoft emerged earlier this week appears to conflict with previously announced plans by Deutsche Telekom and Bertelsmann AG to form an alliance with America Online Inc. in Europe, but officials from both companies sought to play down any dissonance.</p>
<p>When the plans with Bertelsmann were announced last year, the companies held open the option of exchanging stakes between Deutsche Telekom's T-Online and the European unit of America Online, in which Bertelsmann holds a stake.</p>
<p>The planned tie-up between Telekom and Bertelsmann was being forged on the assumption that the Microsoft Network (MSN) would steamroller its way through Europe after its launch, but the service has floundered and has fewer than 100,000 subscribers in Germany.</p>
<p>As a result, it is unlikely regulators would allow any sort of merger or stock swap between T-Online and Dulles, Va.-based America Online.</p>
<p>&quot;We never said we wanted to form an alliance against Microsoft and it also is not true that what we are doing today with Microsoft is directed against Bertelsmann,&quot; said Telekom board member Herbert May at the CeBIT technology fair.</p>
<p>He declined to comment further on talks with Bertelsmann.</p>
<p>Bernd Schiphorst, director of Bertelsmann's online activities, said that with MSN's slow acceptance in Germany the situation had changed but that talks with Telekom had not collapsed. &quot;Talks are continuing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The deal between T-Online and Microsoft also appears to be more bark than bite and is restricted to joint distribution of each other's online service and software licensing.</p>
<p>&quot;T-Online is a means of access,&quot; said Knut Foekler, head of MSN in Germany. &quot;It's a distribution deal not unlike what we have agreed with other carriers such as MCI.&quot;</p>
<p>Bernard Vergnes, president of Microsoft Europe, also made clear that T-Online customers were not getting a free lunch from Microsoft. While MSN would be accessible through T-Online, it would only be accessible to paying MSN customers.</p>
<p>&quot;They must be MSN subscribers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The two companies also plan to jointly market Internet and related technologies based on Microsoft technology making electronic commerce safer.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest commercial bank, has become the first to sign on to use a new home-banking module that T-Online will introduce to its customers to allow secure banking over the Internet.</p>
