<p>Microsoft Corp. sees Latin America and the Far East as areas of &quot;very high growth&quot;, Chairman Bill Gates said Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd say that the Far East and Latin America are the two very high growth areas for Microsoft, and I'm not sure which one will be higher growth,&quot; Gates said during a Microsoft conference in Miami with Latin American business leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very excited about what's going on throughout the region&quot; of Latin America, he added. &quot;We see it as a top growth region for us.&quot;</p>
<p>Microsoft Regional Director for Latin America Mauricio Santillan said in an interview that total sales in the region would be about $500 million this year and that they were growing at a compound rate of 50 percent a year.</p>
<p>&quot;The growth we have had consistently for the last three years has been 50 percent compound a year ... on average,&quot; Santillan said. &quot;Sales ... have to be close to $500 million for this year.&quot;</p>
<p>Santillan said he saw those growth rates continuing at least for the next two or three years. Margins in Latin America were exactly the same as in the rest of the company, he added, but gave no details.</p>
<p>Santillan said market share for Microsoft's Office software was about 90 percent in the region while its Explorer Internet browser had achieved market share of about 60 percent in the region.</p>
<p>Among the company's plans were the introduction of WebTV into Latin America, Gates said.</p>
<p>In April, Microsoft said it agreed to spend $425 million, mostly in stock, to acquire WebTV Networks, a Palo Alto, Calif., start-up which last fall began selling Internet services via television set-top boxes.</p>
<p>&quot;Some time this year we'll come up with a plan to put WebTV in Latin America,&quot; Gates said, adding that the company was considering which partners to link up with in that venture.</p>
<p>Asked what he expected from a high-technology &quot;summit&quot; he has called of more than 100 of the world's top corporate chief executives in Seattle this week, Gates said:</p>
<p>&quot;It's part of our regular ongoing dialogue with business leaders, and there's people from around the world including Latin America who are joining in to that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Vice President Al Gore is one of the attendees, it's a good group.&quot;</p>
<p>The CEOs would be &quot;talking about how the new competitive environment is both a challenge and and opportunity for businesses of all kinds,&quot; he added.</p>
