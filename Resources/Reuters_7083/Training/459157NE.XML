<title>USA: McAfee recovers after recent tech weakness.</title>
<headline>McAfee recovers after recent tech weakness.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares of McAfee Associates Inc showed signs of recovery Friday after the recent wave of technology selling which battered many small capitalization stocks, analysts said.</p>
<p>McAfee, a computer software producer, gained 2-1/2 to 42-1/2 in heavy afternoon trading.</p>
<p>While the entire technology sector has been hard hit lately, some bellwether stocks such as Intel Corp and Microsoft Corp fared better than smaller firms such as McAfee, analysts said.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's been some volatility to the tech sector as a whole.  And there has been a shift to some larger cap tech stocks at the expense of the smaller, less visible stocks,&quot; said John Geurkink, a research associate at Bear Stearns.</p>
<p>McAfee's shares have been volatile since it hit a high of 64-1/2 on February 14.  McAfee's shares sank as low as 38-1/2 on March 19 and have risen steadily in the past two sessions.</p>
<p>McAfee's fundamentals remain strong, making it an attractive buy in the wake of the recent selloff in technology stocks, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The correction upwards is overdue and justified,&quot; said John Powers, an analyst with Robertson Stephens.</p>
<p>McAfee's stock also may have gotten a boost this week due to its recent announcement about the release of a remote diagnostic software product, analysts said.</p>
