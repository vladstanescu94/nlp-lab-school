<p>Sales of recordable compact disc players are booming and so are the sales of the software that makes these 'dumb' drives execute the tasks of storing text, pictures and sound on a CD.</p>
<p>Some 1.5 million CD-R players will be sold in 1996, 10 times more than in 1995 and at rapidly falling retail prices.</p>
<p>Prices are set to plunge to an estimated $500 at year-end from $1,000 in January.</p>
<p>A dozen electronics manufacturers -- including all the big Japanese firms, Hewlett-Packard Co and Dutch Philips Electronics NV -- have launched their first models or will do so soon, but the CD-R software industry is more concentrated.</p>
<p>The CD-R software market is dominated by just three players, one of which is Dutch Elektroson which recently clinched a deal with Netscape Communications Corp and is set to sign another with the U.S. Pentagon.</p>
<p>The 50-person company expects its 1996 sales to surge to $10 million from $3 million in 1995 and says the market's explosive growth is sometimes more than it and sector rivals can handle.</p>
<p>The competitive pricing of the CD-R players has opened up the consumer market, as PC-users crave the storage capacity that can handle the huge multimedia files they find on the Internet.</p>
<p>CD-R players are connected to a PC and usually have the shape and size of a CD-ROM drive. A CD-R disc can save 500 times more information than an ordinary diskette, while it costs a little more than $6, a price which is seen dropping to $5 soon.</p>
<p>Elektroson was set up in the mid-1980s by former optical disc employees of electronics giant Philips, a compact disc pioneer which controls over 50 percent of the CD-R player market and is the largest key component maker.</p>
<p>Several years ago Elektroson was taken over by a group of venture capitalists and radically reshaped from a technology-driven company into a marketing-driven firm by Henk Noorderhaven, executive manager and shareholder.</p>
<p>The firm's main product, Gear, was neatly packaged in platform-independent sets, while its U.S. support office was moved to Silicon Valley from Philadelphia and transformed into a sales organisation.</p>
<p>&quot;If you want to do business in the U.S. you have to be there and you have to have an American profile,&quot; said Elektroson's general manager for Europe, Alfred Klaassen.</p>
<p>The next move will have to come from marketing so-called &quot;slices of Gear&quot;. One of these is Webgrabber, a software application that has been developed for integration in Netscape's Internet browser Navigator.</p>
<p>&quot;Gear is a complex product that can do it all. It's the most reliable and open system available, but it's not plug-and-play. That's one of the reasons we're developing these simpler separate systems,&quot; said product manager Paul Deckers.</p>
<p>Webgrabber allows internet browsers to save files from the net directly to a CD-R.</p>
<p>&quot;We're the first to bring such a programme,&quot; Klaassen said.</p>
<p>Elektroson claims to be number one in Europe and U.S. runner-up behind its U.S. rival  Adaptech. In Europe it ships 15,000 applications a month up from a total 10,000 in the full year of 1995.</p>
<p>Before Christmas it plans to introduce other applications such as one that makes 1:1 copies of every possible CD format and one that can be used to compile audio CD-Rs from other sound recordings.</p>
<p>The company is also working on a &quot;Docu-grabber&quot; for smaller offices that enables indexed mass-archiving and a &quot;Tool-kit&quot; for companies to make their own custom-made Gear application, for example to store presentations which combine pictures and sound.</p>
<p>New digital video disc (DVD) technology will expand these possibilities to include big chunks of video footage.</p>
<p>The company is also developing CD-Rewritable software to allow users to use one CD over and over again by erasing and reloading data. The application is due to come on the market in two years' time.</p>
<p>In the &quot;battle for the slot&quot;, DVD-Rewritable looks destined to replace CD-ROM drives in a few years time.</p>
<p>Elektroson reckons that hardware companies will continue to buy its software to make these DVD-Rs function, even when sales run into many millions and become standard to a PC.</p>
<p>&quot;They rather leave it to a specialised company. It's not just a programme you can develop yourself. It took us 10 years to develop a system without default,&quot; Deckers said.</p>
