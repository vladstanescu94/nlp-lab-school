<p>Netscape Communications Corp. and two other leading Internet companies are proposing a standard for handling the use of private information over the Internet, a move that could boost electronic commerce over the Web.</p>
<p>Representatives of Netscape, Firefly and Verisign said they have already won widespread support for the proposal, which could help manage a thorny issue of protecting privacy over the Internet while promoting commerce.</p>
<p>The proposed standard would enable people to exchange personal profile information over the Internet, while still making it possible for individuals to limit the use and distribution of their private information over the Web.</p>
<p>A study by the Boston Consulting Group (BSG) released in March estimated that instituting measures to provide assurance of privacy over the Internet could boost electronic commerce by $6 billion by 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;It's really the first step of an important new development for Internet commerce and the Web,&quot; said Eric Brown, an analyst at research group Forrester Research.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody wants to create personalized environments and also most people are concerned, or they should be concerned, about personal privacy,&quot; he said. &quot;The two trends are to some extent in conflict with each other.&quot;</p>
<p>The proposed Open Profiling Standard would give each individual control over their own personal profiles and the ability to manage which personal information gets disclosed or withheld from a particular Web site.</p>
<p>The profile data can then be used to provide targeted information, products and services directly to individual users, while allowing them also to be notified every time their profile information is being requested.</p>
<p>Personal profiles contain information ranging from names, addresses, zip codes and phone numbers to marital status, interests, hobbies and passwords.</p>
<p>Individuals could also allow certain sites to exchange the data with other Internet parties, giving rise to the possibility of a whole market for electronic profiles similar to existing demographic data businesses.</p>
<p>People may also choose to have different profiles for business and home use, for example, and perhaps additional profiles for what one expert described as &quot;the darker side,&quot; to receive pornographic material, for instance.</p>
<p>A draft of the new proposed standard, to be formally unveiled on Tuesday, will be filed this week with the Wordwide Web Consortium, or W3C, for consideration and debate -- a process expected to take months to complete.</p>
<p>Already the three companies have rallied a range of organizations -- from major computer makers to privacy protection groups -- behind the new standard.</p>
<p>&quot;We think its a good first step,&quot; said Susan Scott, executive director of eTRUST, an organization formed to establish trust and confidence in electronic transactions which monitors online privacy and develops guidelines.</p>
<p>Scott said eTRUST, which was formed last year with the backing of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and was involved in the BSG study, had provided input.</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard Co., American Express Co., International Business Machines Co., SportsWire USA and The New York Times, along with privacy groups like EFF, are supporting the proposal.</p>
<p>Microsoft was not on the list of initial supporters and its executives could not immediately be reached for comment. But industry analysts said they did not expect the proposal to be extremely controversial.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there's going to be a lot of friction or complaints. There's not a lot of food fighting to be had here,&quot; said Brown.</p>
<p>&quot;It's great for consumers. It will save a lot of aggravation for having to type a lot of stuff into a Web site,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Estimates differ on how quickly the standard might be accepted and begin appearing in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Brown said it could begin having an impact by year-end, while Geoffrey Bock of the Patricia Seybold Group estimated it may take up to 36 months to implement.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not going to be something that is going to impact us tomorrow,&quot; Bock said. &quot;I think it will benefit all the companies that are sponsoring it because it will contribute to the growth of Internet commerce.&quot;</p>
