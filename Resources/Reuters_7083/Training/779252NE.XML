<title>USA: ADR REPORT - Israeli ADRs trade higher on earnings.</title>
<headline>ADR REPORT - Israeli ADRs trade higher on earnings.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-08-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Israeli drug and computer companies had their American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) trading higher amid good volume in the wake of strong earnings reports, dealers said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries was 2-6/16 higher at 60-1/16, while Check Point Software Technologies Ltd was 2-1/4 higher at 26-1/2.</p>
<p>&quot;People are still buying it up,&quot; said one dealer about Teva. &quot;It's good value.&quot;  </p>
<p>On Monday, Teva reported a profit of $0.55 per share for the second quarter, coming in line with analysts' estimates. The figure was much higher than the $0.01 per share profit after charges that the company reported for the same period last year.</p>
<p>Teva also said Copaxone, its treatment for multiple sclerosis, was capturing the majority of new prescriptions in the United States.</p>
<p>Check Point was just as active even though it released its earnings on July 30, reporting a profit of $0.21 per share against $0.10 a year ago.  </p>
<p>Singapore's multimedia company Creative Technology Ltd was 1-1/4 higher at 22-1/8, coming close to its year high in the latest of a string of days in which its ADR has traded actively.</p>
<p>A dealer referred to the company's strong earnings as the cause for the extended rally in the ADR. On July 28, it reported a profit of $0.55 per share for the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $0.43 a year ago. A day later, Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co raised its fiscal 1998 earnings estimates for Creative to $2.35 per share from $2.25.  </p>
<p>Latin American ADRs were relatively quiet, Telebras SA was up 1-7/8 at 138-3/8 and Banco Wiese Ltd SA of Peru was 1/2 higher at 7-1/8.</p>
<p>Telefonica de Argentina was 1/4 down at 38-1/4 in light trading despite a downgrade announced earlier in the day. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter set it at neutral from outperform due to weaker-than-expected third-quarter revenues.</p>
<p>&quot;(But) the downgrade came late,&quot; said one dealer, explaining it might have had more of an impact if it had come on the same day as the release of the earnings on Monday.  </p>
<p>Another trader specializing in Asian ADRs said Thai companies were not moving much, despite the harsh set of reforms implemented by the government in an effort to revitalize the country's economy.</p>
<p>&quot;They never have much volume,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Among European ADRs, Royal Dutch Petroleum Co was up 1/4 at 56-1/8.</p>
<p>Decliners led advancers 292 to 239 among 814 ADRs. The ADR group was down 0.10 percent on volume of 45.5 million ADRs.</p>
<p>ADRs enable U.S. trading of foreign stock.</p>
