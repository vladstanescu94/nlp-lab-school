<p>Canada's cable television companies announced on Tuesday a nationwide rollout of a high-speed Internet service that will be available to more than 2 million subscribers by next year.</p>
<p>Called Wave, the service allows access to the global network of computer networks at speeds up to 10 times faster than regular telephone line connections.</p>
<p>&quot;The Internet is an amazing place. Wave turns it into a faster, amazing place,&quot; said Ted Rogers, president of Rogers Communications Inc., Canada's largest cable operator.</p>
<p>Rogers told a news conference that some 200,000 Rogers cable subscribers will have access to Wave by the end of the year and some 1.5 million will be added next year.</p>
<p>Shaw Communications Inc. said it expects to have the service available to more than 500,000 subscribers by the fall of 1997.</p>
<p>Rogers, along with other cable companies, has already tested the service in communities across Canada and found demand strong. The companies said they have invested tens of millions of dollars to upgrade lines to launch the service.</p>
<p>Wave is available at C$55 (US$41) a month for a year's subscription, with a C$150 (US$113) installation fee. It includes rental of a cable communications modem and an Ethernet card, hardware needed to hook up to computer networks.</p>
<p>Subscribers have access to up to five e-mail addresses and may create their own page on the World Wide Web with up to 5 megabytes of information.</p>
<p>Cable officials said subscribers can leave the service online 24 hours a day and will have access to the Internet with either Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Explorer or Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browsers.</p>
<p>Because a high percentage of Canadian homes have access to cable, the new service could provide strong competition to telephone companies and other Internet service providers.</p>
<p>A cable official said the service will be faster than special ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) lines offered by telephone companies but slightly slower than new digital high-speed lines know as ADSL that are being installed by some telephone companies. Cable companies are also testing modems that would increase speeds even more, however.</p>
<p>Rogers said the new service represents a huge new customer base to tap.</p>
<p>&quot;In one leap forward, the cable industry has become a major player in the Internet,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Shaw President Jim Shaw said the service will put the cable industry on a firm national footing against Canada's big telephone firms.</p>
<p>&quot;It has become the vehicle to make the industry a new national powerhouse,&quot; Shaw said.</p>
