<p>- Fulcrum Technologies Inc expects to emerge from the red in the third quarter and turn a profit in the fourth as forecast by analysts, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Eric Goodwin said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The analysts are projecting that we're going to have losses in the first two quarters, and sort of break even in the third and be profitable in the fourth,&quot; Goodwin said.</p>
<p>He added he felt comfortable with those expectations for the software maker, which completes its fiscal year on December 31.</p>
<p>Fulcrum, in the midst of shifting its strategy to creating broader database search-and-retrieval software, posted 1996 fourth quarter losses of C$.91 a share in mid-February including a non-recurring charge of C$13.9 million for research and development expenses. It told investors that one software product, based on Microsoft's network (add Microsoft ric), was hampered by slow than expected sales of Microsoft Exchange.</p>
<p>A year earlier Fulcrum made a profit of C$0.46 a share.</p>
<p>Ottawa-based Fulcrum, which writes products to find information on internal company link-ups called Intranets, is creating a new product, due out in March, to boost lagging interest.</p>
<p>&quot;We're coming out with a new product that will take some ramp time to develop the kind of success stories that I believe are inevitable,&quot; Goodwin said.</p>
<p>Goodwin also said the company was caught in a philosophy shift as companies decide between two database systems: keeping their information on their own networks, such as Lotus Notes, or using an Intranet which is based on the world-wide network of the Web to store data.</p>
<p>Fulcrum's new product will search both types of storage systems, as opposed to its older software which only used company-wide systems, Goodwin said.</p>
<p>Fulcrum, which posted C$60 million in 1996 revenues, saw its share price drop in early 1997 as investors learned about the upcoming losses. However the stock price has climbed 30 percent in the last three weeks on more positive investor sentiment, Goodwin said.</p>
<p>Fulcrum shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange were down 0.35 to 6.45 on Monday, while on Nasdaq they fell 1/16 to 4-13/16.</p>
