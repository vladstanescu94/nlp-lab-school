<p>Zenith Electronics Corp, after a false start, is taking a second stab at an Internet television product, adding new partners and a new platform, Chief Executive Officer Peter Willmott told Reuters.</p>
<p>The company last May announced that it would collaborate with Diba Inc, the Menlo Park, Calif.-based software company to collaborate on interactive television technology to let viewers surf the Internet on their TV sets.  </p>
<p>However, Zenith failed to deliver a product in time for the 1996 Christmas selling season, and Willmott said none is imminent from the Diba collaboration.</p>
<p>Zenith on Wednesday said it made alliances to launch new Internet television products with Network Computer Inc, a unit of Oracle Corp, and with Navio Communications Inc, the consumer affiliate of Netscape Communications Corp.  </p>
<p>&quot;We still have a relationship with Diba, but the platform we have today is our central driving force,&quot; Willmott said in a telephone interview on the eve of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. He declined to quantify the investment Zenith has made in Diba.</p>
<p>&quot;We have come up with partners that provide a great platform for future growth in this segment of the business,&quot; Willmott said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We'll move very quickly, since we were slow to get a product to market,&quot; Willmott said, noting the new Internet TV products are scheduled for market introduction &quot;in the latter half of 1997.&quot;</p>
<p>He would not discuss price. Analysts expect the hardware could add $600 to the cost of a large-screen television. The devices will include set-top boxes, which sell for less than $500.  </p>
<p>Diba vice president Joe Gillach told Reuters, &quot;We delivered a piece of the product to Zenith, which has to assemble many into a solution. It takes more than one company to supply all the pieces.&quot;</p>
<p>Gillach, who said Zenith is a major investor in Diba, added his company would take a &quot;wait and see&quot; posture on the direction of its future involvement with Zenith.</p>
<p>Willmott said Zenith's restructuring program, announced in December, was on track. In a move to accelerate its return to profitability, the company is cutting its U.S. workforce by more than 25 percent.</p>
<p>Willmott also said plans for a proposed $100 million large-screeen picture tube plant in suburban Woodridge, Ill. remained &quot;on hold.&quot;</p>
<p>Zenith's last full year of profitability was 1988.</p>
