<p>Computer technology developer Formulab Neuronetics Corp Ltd said on Thursday that heavy trade in the stock on Wednesday and early Thursday not a selldown by founder Tony Richter but a shuffling of his shareholding.</p>
<p>In a statement, the company said Richter had tranferred his interests to legal entities under his control.</p>
<p>Market speculation on Wednesday was that Richter had sold out with the large volumes accounted for by the release from escrow of shares held by Richter.  </p>
<p>The bulk of Wednesday's business was in two lines of 150.54 million and 28.25 million shares, both at 25 cents per share, specialled through Prudential-Bache Securities Australia.</p>
<p>However, these two lines were both cancelled after trading closed on Wednesday and the same parcels were again specialled through Prudential Bache Securities at the opening on Thursday, this time at 27 cents per share.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Formulab said he was unable to explain the way the trades had been processed.  </p>
<p>The company said its substantial shareholders had advised that they had commenced conversio of &quot;A&quot; class options, with completion expected by September 30.</p>
<p>The A$10.04 million raised from the conversion would be used to continue its U.S. expansion, the company said.</p>
<p>By 11.00 a.m. 90100 GMT), Formulab shares were half a cent lower at 28 cents on turnover of 179.74 million.</p>
