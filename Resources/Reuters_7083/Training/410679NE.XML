<title>USA: Intuit falls after slowing sales forecast.</title>
<headline>Intuit falls after slowing sales forecast.</headline>

<p>Intuit Inc's share price fell as much 18 percent early Friday after the financial software company said it expects slowing sales for at least the next two quarters.</p>
<p>Intuit, publisher of the Quicken electronic checkbook program, was off just 1/8 at 25-1/8 near midday, but earlier it traded as low as 20-7/8.  </p>
<p>On Thursday Intuit reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that were better than Wall Street expected, but company executives told analysts that sales for the rest of the fiscal year would slow amid rising competition from Microsoft Corp. and other financial software vendors.</p>
<p>&quot;The company is cautious about further growth in personal finance as we expect softness in consumer software during the remainder of the year,&quot; said James Heeger, chief financial officer of the Menlo Park, Calif., company.  </p>
<p>Intuit has been looking for sources of revenue other than software sales ever since a merger with Microsoft fell through in early 1995. Since then, Microsoft has been practically giving away financial software to gain on Intuit.</p>
<p>To counter, Intuit has slashed prices of Quicken, turned to PC makers to distribute its products, and poured money into developing financial services on the Internet.</p>
<p>Investors, however, do not expect significant revenues from the new services for several quarters.  </p>
<p>At least one analyst, Michael Kwatinetz of investment bank Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, cut his rating on Intuit to &quot;hold&quot; from &quot;accumulate,&quot; based on slowing growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Although Intuit may achieve its earnings per-share target this year by managing costs, we believe next year's earnings will be lower than we had expected,&quot; Kwatinetz wrote in a report released today.</p>
<p>After the market closed Thursday, Intuit said profit from operations for the second quarter ended January 31 was $52.3 million, or $1.10 a share. Wall Street had expected operating profit of $1.08 a share, according to First Call.</p>
<p>Second-quarter revenue rose 21 percent, to $266 million from $219 million the year before.</p>
