<title>USA: U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Intuit active on takeover talk.</title>
<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Intuit active on takeover talk.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-11-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Takeover rumors on Intuit Inc led to an increase in options trading Wednesday, traders said.</p>
<p>Both Intuit and rumored bidder American Express Co declined to comment on the talk that drove shares of Intuit up seven to 36-1/2 on 4.49 million shares.</p>
<p>Intuit called the rumor &quot;wild.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said the takeover talk touched off heavier than usual action in Intuit options, led by the November 35 calls, which traded about 2,315 contracts.  </p>
<p>The option rose 3-3/16 to 3-3/8 and had not traded since October 25. Its open interest was 216.</p>
<p>The November 40 call rose 1-11/16 to 1-3/4 on volume of about 1,025 contracts. It had not traded since October 21 and had open interest of eight.</p>
<p>Heavy action was also seen in the January 35 call, which traded 1,075 contracts. It rose 4-7/16 to 5-3/4.</p>
<p>This contract had open interest of 1,008 contracts. It traded 43 contracts Tuesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;The January 35's (action) is probably hedging against people speculating with the November 35's, which probably is indicative of a takeover around the 40 area,&quot; one options strategist said.</p>
<p>The most active Intuit put was the November 35, which traded about 530 contracts. It dropped 3-3/8 to 2-1/4. Its open interest was 40.</p>
<p>In other activity, a couple of big trades were seen in long term options, or LEAPS, on shares of Seagate Technology.  </p>
<p>The Seagate January 1998 60 call traded 5,767 contracts in one block and the January 1998 60 put traded 2,506 contracts in two blocks, most of which crossed in one block of 2,500.</p>
<p>The call had open interest of about 6,500 and the put had open interest of 2,585.</p>
<p>Seagate shares closed at 74-7/8, up three.</p>
<p>Michael Schwartz at Oppenheimer &amp; Co said LEAPS often trade in big blocks such as the ones in Seagate.</p>
<p>Given the call's steep premium of 21-7/8, the investor was not likely buying them unless it was to close out a position, Schwartz said. --Gregory Crawford, (312) 408-8750</p>
