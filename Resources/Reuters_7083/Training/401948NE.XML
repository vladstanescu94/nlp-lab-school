<title>USA: Microsoft launches new version of investor service.</title>

<p>Microsoft Corp. said Monday it launched a new version of its Microsoft Investor online service with beefed-up editorial content, a revised look and more options for electronic trading.</p>
<p>The software giant, which launched the service in October with the option to trade electronically through Fidelity Investments and brokerage Charles Schwab &amp; Co. Inc., announced new trading relationships with E-Trade Group Inc. and PC Financial Network.</p>
<p>Kirk Koenigsbauer, product manager for the service, said he expected to add more brokerages to the offering, but he said fees from trading would be a &quot;very, very small percentage&quot; of the revenue stream going forward.</p>
<p>Instead he said in an interview that the lion's share of revenues would come from advertising and subscription fees for unspecified premium services, likely to be offered beginning later this year.</p>
<p>Currently Microsoft Investor is available to anyone with Internet access, and Koenigsbauer said Microsoft would never charge for basic services needed for investors to follow their personal portfolios.</p>
<p>But he said the next version of the product, expected out in four to six months, would offer some type of premium information or software that helps users make a choice among various investments such as specific stocks or mutual funds.</p>
<p>Microsoft also is building a team of writers and editors specifically for the investment site at the company's suburban Seattle campus and complemented by free-lance contributors.</p>
<p>The staff, headed by editor Dan Fisher, who spent 26 years at the Los Angeles Times, produces daily market summaries and topical columns on investing.</p>
