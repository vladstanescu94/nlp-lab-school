<p>Xscribe Corp said Friday Chief Operating and Chief Financial Officer Bruce Myers has resigned, effective November 30, as part of a restructuring.</p>
<p>Evan Wyly and Donald Miller Jr also resigned as company directors, reducing the board to five from seven menbers.</p>
<p>The company said the changes were made in connection with the reorganization and downsizing necessitated by the recent sale of the company's court-reporting products business.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the company has decided to focus its efforts on its scanner business and move away from its court reporting business. It will operate primarily through its Photomatrix Corp unit.</p>
<p>&quot;These cost-motivated decisions are part of the company's overall plans to reduce operating costs by at least $800,000 annually, effective no later than March 31, 1997,&quot; said Suren Dutia, Xscribe's president and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>&quot;These cost reductions are designed to help our goal of returning to profitability in the near future,&quot; she added.</p>
