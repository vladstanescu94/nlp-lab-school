<headline>Wall Data sees lower-than-expected net, CEO to retire.</headline>
<dateline>KIRKLAND, Wash. 1997-07-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Wall Data Inc. said Monday its second-quarter earnings will be just half of what investors had expected and that it will take a $10.7 million charge to settle a shareholder lawsuit.</p>
<p>The network software company, based in Kirkland, Wash., also said Chairman Jim Simpson will retire at the end of July in a move that surprised some industry analysts. John Wall, founder and president, will take over as chairman and chief executive.</p>
<p>Wall Data has had a hard time meeting Wall Street earnings forecasts in recent years and its stock has suffered. Sales of its software products, which connect networks of personal computers to mainframes, have been slowing.</p>
<p>Wall Data specializes in writing software that lets personal copmuter users tap data stored on mainframe computers. Monday's announcement marked the third time in a  little more than two years that Wall Data has told investors quarterly earnings would fall well short of expectations.</p>
<p>Wall Data's stock was halted before the announcement. Its stock closed up 75 cents at $27.75.</p>
<p>For the quarter ended June 30, Wall Data said it expects to report earnings, before charges, of 17 to 20 cents a share. Analysts expected Wall Data to earn 34 cents a share, according to a recent survey by Zacks Investment Research.</p>
<p>Second-quarter revenue will be about $35.5 million, up from $34.8 million a year earlier, the company said.</p>
<p>Wall Data also said it will take a $10.7 million charge to settle a shareholder lawsuit filed shortly after it suffered a huge stock drop in early 1995. The charge also covers the costs of restructuring the company's Salsa business unit, which writes multi-user database software.</p>
<p>Rob Owens of Pacific Crest Securities said the news was &quot;disappointing,&quot; and he was surprised the company had settled the class-action lawsuit. Owens also said he was surprised that Simpson, 59, will retire.</p>
<p>Simpson and other executives could not be reached for comment but the company said in a statement that Simpson's retirement was part of a &quot;phased management succession plan.&quot;</p>
<p>Last October, Wall Data lost about a third of its value after an earnings shortfall. The stock fell about 50 percent after a similar announcement in 1995.</p>
