<headline>Microsoft to help PC makers break into the TV business.</headline>
<dateline>SAN FRANCISCO</dateline>
<text>
<p>Microsoft Corp., looking for new markets to keep its revenue growth going, said Tuesday it will help the computer hardware industry turn the personal computer into an advanced television set.</p>
<p>Microsoft, the world's biggest personal computer software company, said upcoming versions of its Windows operating system will be able to display broadcast television and Digital Versatile Disk, or DVD, video. The video quality on a PC, in fact, will surpass that on a new generation of digital television sets, the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;One of our priorities is really putting the PC in the centre of entertainment part of your home,&quot; Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates told a crowd of 10,000 hardware engineers in San Francisco. &quot;We expect that to be a very big market.&quot;</p>
<p>Microsoft, and other industry pillars such Intel Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp., are trying to persuade the broadcast television industry and government regulatory agencies to adopt some of their technologies that would let people watch TV through their PCs. The TV-capable PC is one of the computer industry's best hope for sustaining double-digit growth.</p>
<p>Gates said one of Microsoft's top priorities is developing the Windows CE operating system for advanced television sets. Microsoft unveiled Windows CE last fall as a programme to control the fundamental functions of non-traditional computers, such as set-top boxes, pagers, cellular phones and advanced TV sets.</p>
<p>Gates also said his company is developing extensions, or software add-ins, for upcoming versions of Windows 95 and Windows NT that would let the programmes control entertainment centres and play cinematic-quality video.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Microsoft paid $425 million to buy WebTV Networks Inc., a maker of special set-top boxes that let television viewers read e-mail and browse the World Wide Web without a PC.</p>
<p>Gates argues that because the personal computer has always been digital, it is much better suited to handle digital video and audio signals -- either from satellite, cable or video players -- than the digital TV format being proposed by the television industry.</p>
<p>In his keynote at the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference, Gates also urged PC engineers to make personal computers easier to use and manage by adopting some of Microsoft's recently proposed technology standards.</p>
<p>The standards include OnNow, which would make the PC available for use the instant it is turned on; and the NetPC, a set of specifications for bare-bone computers that would draw their computing power from corporate networks.</p>
