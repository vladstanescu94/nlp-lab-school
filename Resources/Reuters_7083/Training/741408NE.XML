<p>Soft drinks giant Coca-Cola is driving deep into Africa in an investment expansion expected to draw other U.S. companies along.</p>
<p>Go to the remotest rural areas in most of southern Africa and more often than not, the drink of choice at the local shop is Coca-Cola.</p>
<p>Sub-Saharan Africa's push to attract U.S. investment steps up a gear on Tuesday when an African-American summit opens in Harare.</p>
<p>After encountering some criticism for staying on in South Africa during the apartheid years, Coca-Cola is now quickly branching out to sub-Saharan Africans to become the most visible U.S. investor in the region.</p>
<p>In South Africa, Africa's economic bulwark, the corporation and its seven bottlers announced early this year that it was investing $275 million there to strengthen its market share.</p>
<p>The company said it intended to double its business in South Africa as a result of the investment. Sales are running at around 4.8 billion rand ($1.1 billion) a year at retail level.</p>
<p>AGGRESSIVE DRIVE AGAINST ARCH-RIVAL PEPSI</p>
<p>Its aggressive investment drive to entrench itself in the country forced its arch-rival Pepsi to beat a hasty retreat after re-entering the market three years ago with the focus mainly on black consumers.</p>
<p>From South Africa, Coca-Cola is striding north to Zimbabwe -- the region's second-largest economy -- where it is to invest $60 million over the next four years. The company aims to double its business in the country, where it already has 85 percent of the market.</p>
<p>Tanzania and Uganda are next in line, drawing investments of $30 million each.</p>
<p>The company also sees prospects for expansion in Portuguese-speaking Angola and Mozambique, which are slowly recovering from almost two decades of civil war.</p>
<p>It is already in Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland.</p>
<p>&quot;We're very positive on Africa as a whole,&quot; Coca-Cola president and chief operating officer Doug Ivester said in early February during a visit to southern Africa.</p>
<p>OTHER COMPANIES JOIN TREK</p>
<p>That vote of confidence in the continent's potential is seeping through to other large American corporations.</p>
<p>Industry sources in Zimbabwe say the Big Mac of fast food giant McDonald's might soon be washed down with Coca-Cola. McDonald's is already in South Africa.</p>
<p>Software giant Microsoft Corp says it plans to open 10 to 20 new sales offices in Africa by the year 2000. It opened an office in South Africa in 1992 with a view to using it as a base to expand into the rest of the continent.</p>
<p>In February, it opened offices in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and Nairobi, Kenya.</p>
<p>&quot;Africa is the last developing region in the world. We hope to have 10 to 20 new sales offices in Africa by the year 2000,&quot; Phil Allcock, business manager for Regional Africa, said.</p>
<p>Regional Africa is Africa south of the Sahara Desert, excluding South Africa and including the Indian Ocean islands.</p>
<p>&quot;We are expecting Africa to be our next big market. The business opportunities there are untapped and require 'hands on' management to understand the market dynamics of each country,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>U.S. commodities corporation Cargill has also set up business in Zimbabwe and so has International Business Machines (IBM) which opened its office in Zimbabwe last year.</p>
<p>PLANNED SUMMIT AIMS TO BOOST AFRICA-U.S. TIES</p>
<p>The African-African American summit has attracted a host of big players from U.S. business, all scrambling for a place in the African market.</p>
<p>Organisers say some Fortune 500 companies, including Owens Corning, Chrysler, Colgate-Palmolive, Kellogg, Chevron  Chv.N, Royal Dutch/Shell Group unit Shell Oil Co and Procter and Gamble would be sending their chief executives to hear for themselves about investment opportunities.</p>
<p>They said the U.S. government had confirmed it would send an envoy.</p>
<p>The summit -- convened by Leon Sullivan, a leading black U.S. civil rights activist who has been at the forefront of a campaign to promote U.S.-African relations -- is aimed at drumming up investment in the continent.</p>
