<headline>3Com, network companies down as Intel steps up threat.</headline>

<p>The stocks of 3Com Corp. and other computer networking companies sagged Monday after Intel Corp. unveiled inexpensive gear aimed at speeding links among personal computers.</p>
<p>&quot;This is aimed at 3Com most specifically,&quot; one analyst said, referring to Intel's new product plans.</p>
<p>Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel said it will introduce a competitively priced networking hub and a device with a single chip that could be used to reduce the cost of building networks while enabling so-called computer workgroups to be upgraded to faster speeds.</p>
<p>3Com fell $2.875 to $26.375 on Nasdaq, where it was the fifth most actively traded stock.</p>
<p>Bay Networks Inc. stock fell 62.5 cents to $17, and Cabletron Systems Inc. fell $1.25 to $30.125 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. Robotics Corp., which has agreed to a merger with 3Com, shed $5.69 to $45.06 on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>Cisco Systems Inc., the leader in networking, closed down $1.06 at $47.31, even though its products are aimed more at the core of major computer networks such as the Internet.</p>
<p>Executives at Intel, the world's largest semiconductor maker and the dominant supplier of the microprocessors that are the heart of PCs, said its networking products were in part an extension of its efforts to accelerate the pace of technological adaptation as a way of boosting demand for more powerful processors.</p>
<p>Intel shares rose $1.25 to $138.375. Cisco and Intel were the third and fourth most active stocks on the Nasdaq market, respectively.</p>
<p>Intel's announcements Monday included a network hub that is considerably cheaper than devices now on the market.</p>
<p>In its second announcement, Intel's Hillsboro, Ore.-based Internet and Communications Group said it was offering limited samples of what it called the first chip able to provide speedy network connections right on a PC's motherboard.</p>
<p>The Fast Ethernet silicon device provides basic networking functions plus remote management features.</p>
<p>Intel executives said the device can be produced at about half the price of previous PC networking products, and said the percentage of PCs shipped with built-in networking on their main circuit board may rise from the current level of less than 10 percent.</p>
<p>More than 40 million network-equipped computers are shipped a year, and one Intel executive said as many as 40 percent of those may soon ship with such built-in networking capabilities.</p>
