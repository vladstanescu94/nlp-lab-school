<p>Indian scientists, thwarted in their bid to buy a U.S.-made supercomputer four years ago, on Sunday said a massively parallel supercomputing facility they had developed was ready for shared use by companies.</p>
<p>Scientists at the Indian Institute of Science (IIS) in this southern city said they began work on the supercomputing facility after the United States in 1993 rejected their bid to buy a Cray Research Inc supercomputer.</p>
<p>&quot;If there is one field where India can compete with the advanced countries it is in science and technology,&quot; Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda told the scientists at a ceremony to dedicate the facility.</p>
<p>India's Meteorological Department bought a Cray XMP14 supercomputer in the mid-1980s for weather research and forecasting which was to be used under close U.S. supervision.</p>
<p>The 1993 Cray sale was vetoed by Washington when India attempted to buy cryogenic (low-temperature) rocket technology from Russia, a deal that also fell through.</p>
<p>Scientists at IIS said the United States did not permit IIS to buy the Cray supercomputer because of fears it would be diverted into weapons research. The IIS played a role in designing the Agni, India's intermediate range ballistic missile which was first test-fired in 1989.</p>
<p>N. Balakrishnan, the head of the IIS supercomputing centre, told Reuters: &quot;Its (the parallel computing facility) magnitude and capacity are several times higher than the one denied to India by the U.S. government.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If we had gone in for the Cray supercomputer it would have become obsolete by now. Moreover, technology has shifted out from the single mainframe to distributory networks. What we have here is several mammals instead of a single monster.&quot;</p>
<p>Balakrishnan said the facility consisted of powerful computers linked by high-speed communication networks. He said global giants like International Business Machines Corp and Microsoft Corp were negotiating tie-ups with the centre.</p>
<p>&quot;Microsoft has also entered into an agreement for software development programme with the centre. They will announce details in New Delhi this week,&quot; Balakrishnan said.</p>
<p>Microsoft chairman Bill Gates is scheduled to arrive in New Delhi on Monday on a four-day visit to India during which he will meet with the heads of 500 software firms in Bombay. He is not visiting Bangalore, often called India's Silicon Valley for its concentration of highly-skilled software writers.</p>
<p>The IIS facility conducts research in numerical and non-numerical algorithms used in large-scale and parallel computing. It also researches hardware for multi-processor systems, computer networking and software engineering.</p>
<p>Unlike normal computers which do calculations sequentially, parallel computers break up a task into parts and then perform them simultaneously, or in parallel, distributing the load among its processors. The greater the number of parallel processors, the greater the speed.</p>
<p>India has been developing parallel supercomputing for several years. The Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC) in Pune, near Bombay, was set up in 1988.</p>
<p>CDAC, which has already sold several of its Param supercomputers to foreign buyers, is working on a prototype Teraflop computer which can perform one trillion calculations per second.</p>
