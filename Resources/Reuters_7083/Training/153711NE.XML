<headline>CD-Rom celebrates madcap Marxism.</headline>

<p>Julius, Leonard, Arthur and Herbert were the ultimate show business family. Driven by Minnie, their irrepressible stage mother, they spent years learning the ropes in Vaudeville.</p>
<p>First a singing act known as The Four Nightingales, they eventually becoming a comedy team in 1910 after they tried madcap stunts for an easily-distracted audience in Texas and the crowd loved it.</p>
<p>They got their nicknames during a backstage game of stud poker, when a now-forgotten comedian named Art Fisher decided to name Leonard after a chicken chaser, which was the term for someone who kept running after women.</p>
<p>Herbert, legend has it, was loosely named after a circus freak named Zippo. Julius was nicknamed either for his disposition or for the grouch bags people wore around their neck to keep their valuables safe. Arthur was named for the instrument he played.</p>
<p>It was only after they hit it big on Broadway and a New York critic discovered their nicknames during a backstage visit that the world got to know the four as Groucho, Chico (properly pronounced Chick-O), Harpo and Zeppo -- the Marx Brothers.</p>
<p>&quot;The Unknown Marx Brothers&quot; from Philips Media (800-883-3767, Windows/Macintosh, $40) contains lots of such tidbits.</p>
<p>The two-disk retrospective of one of the world's funniest (and certainly most irreverent) comedy teams contains more than two hours of video from separate documentaries first aired on The Disney Channel in the fall of 1993 and 1994.</p>
<p>The video documentary, which can be watched in chunks or in its entirety, has home movies; interviews with the children of Groucho, Harpo and Chico; the &quot;dialogue&quot; in Harpo's first silent film; long-lost footage; movie trailers; and outtakes from &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; that were clipped by the censors.</p>
<p>The disadvantage to viewing this CD-ROM instead of the original documentary, which is being released on video, is that the pictures can be choppy, you get more detail from video tape, and you can flip back and forth through the video, something that should be possible with the computer, but isn't.</p>
<p>But unlike the video, the CD-ROM lets you explore the life of the Marxes at your own pace. It has a detailed chronology of their careers, a trivia game, publicity photos, information (and reviews) of all their movies, and details of their long list of television appearances. There are also some audio snippets from their failed radio programmes, such as &quot;Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel.&quot;</p>
<p>So get to know &quot;The Unknown Marx Brothers.&quot; And if someone asks where they got their nicknames, or where Groucho got the idea for that ridiculously-fake moustache, or why Harpo suddenly became the Marx brother who never spoke, you'll know.</p>
<p>    -   -   -   -</p>
<p>There are plenty of other world atlas products on CD-ROM, but &quot;Compton's Interactive World Atlas&quot; (Compton's NewMedia, Windows, $45) claims to provide &quot;3D flight anywhere in the world.&quot; Yea, right.</p>
<p>My home state of Rhode Island has a huge, beautiful bay that runs up the centre of the state. The thought of taking a simulated flight up Narragansett Bay using data from satellite images was enough to entice me to crack open the box.</p>
<p>Taken literally, &quot;Compton's&quot; keeps its promise to let you &quot;fly&quot; anywhere on Earth. But the trip is at an altitude that gives you absolutely no surface detail. The bay was unrecognizable, and about the only thing I could make out clearly on the U.S. flyover was Florida, the Great Lakes and Long Island.</p>
<p>The box talks about controlling direction, altitude and speed &quot;as you watch detailed satellite images of the world pass beneath you.&quot; Wrong. The only detail I saw came in static, stand-alone photographs from space.</p>
<p>&quot;Compton's&quot; has plenty of maps, time zone data, climate information, and statistics about population, education and agriculture. Just take some of the hype with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>    -   -   -   -</p>
<p>Some new and notable software in the stores this week:</p>
<p>&quot;The Genius of Edison&quot; (Compton's NewMedia, Windows/Macintosh, $40) -- A look at America's most prolific inventor, the man who gave us lightbulbs, phonographs, electric trains, stock tickers and talking dolls.</p>
<p>&quot;Deadly Tide&quot; (Microsoft, Windows95, $55) -- With a prototype underwater attack ship, players must battle aliens who live in the world's oceans.</p>
<p>&quot;Ace Ventura&quot; (7th Level, Windows, $45) tries to be as rude as the movies. It promises four villains and &quot;hot chicks in tight clothing,&quot; along with &quot;butt yodeling.&quot; It's for ages 13 and older.</p>
<p>&quot;My Very First Software&quot; (Broderbund, Windows/Macintosh, $30) -- Because young children aren't born knowing how to use a mouse or the basics of a keyboard, this programme for ages 2 to 5 teaches them. It works in English, Spanish, German and French. Broderbund also offers &quot;My Very First Art Studio&quot; and &quot;My Very First Storybook&quot; for the same price.</p>
<p>&quot;Road Rash&quot; (Electronic Arts, Windows95, $50) -- A motorcycle racing game that can be played over a modem or a computer network. It promises to let you &quot;dodge traffic, outrace cops and thrash pedestrians on your way to winning the Cup and becoming the menace to society your mother always worried about.&quot;</p>
