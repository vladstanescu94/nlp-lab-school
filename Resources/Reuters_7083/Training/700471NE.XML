<p>Software group Solution 6 Holdings Ltd plans more acquisitions following the purchase of Computer Automated Business Systems Pty Ltd (CABS) on Tuesday, chief executive officer (CEO) Chris Tyler said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are intending to grow the revenue base through acquisitions where there is a big strategic step and also we would be very aggressive in growing our business organically,&quot; Tyler told Reuters in a telephone interview.  </p>
<p>Tyler, who was appointed CEO two months ago, said the group no longer had plans to seek an equity partner in its loss making Internet Service Provider business Access One.</p>
<p>&quot;What we see is a very sharp growth of Access One and a net reduction in our net operating losses and so we are starting to see an ability to get it operating profitably here in the first half of the (1997/98) year,&quot; Tyler said.</p>
<p>&quot;So we can't imagine a better growth opportunity. We are going to focus Access One as a very high end network for business and government organisations to run their critical applications on,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Tyler said Access One would not focus on the consumer Internet market.</p>
<p>The group planned to focus on its three core businesses of Access One, accountancy software and electronic commerce. The group plans to sell its software programmes across the Internet, Tyler said.</p>
<p>He said the deregulation of Australia's telecommunications sector would lead to lower costs and enhance revenues for the company, whose biggest cost is telecoms charges.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are very excited about deregulation because we feel competition will drive the cost of bandwidth down, which is our largest cost, so that will enhance our operating structure and also boost our revenue,&quot; Tyler said.</p>
<p>He said the group was investigating whether to apply for a telecoms licence. A decision will be made in the next three months.</p>
<p>&quot;There may some opportunities to improve our cost structure by establishing carrier status,&quot; Tyler said.  </p>
<p>However, Solution 6 was likely to record another loss in the year ended June 30, on top of the A$2.06 million net loss posted in 1995/96, before it turned to profit in 1997/98.</p>
<p>&quot;It is going to be a very bad operating year on the full year result, but we think that we can get the company to operate on a profitable basis in the next fiscal year,&quot; Tyler said.</p>
<p>&quot;It won't turn the corner overnight but mid-year we will expect the group to be operating in the black and having a net profit for the (1997/98) year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Solution 6 shares closed three cents down at 91 cents on Tuesday.  </p>
