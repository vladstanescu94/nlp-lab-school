<headline>German company backs staff amid insider trade probe.</headline>

<p>Software maker SAP AG, whose dizzying ascent on the Frankfurt stock market has made it one of Germany's most popular stocks, emerged Monday as the focus of a major insider trading probe.</p>
<p>SAP is under investigation on allegations that some of its staff members and associates dealt illegally in its stock during a period of extreme price volatility last year, authorities said.</p>
<p>The probe, still in its early stages, concerns more than 100 individuals, a spokesman for Germany's stock market watchdog told Reuters, saying it could become the most serious case since insider trading was criminalized here in 1994.</p>
<p>The company said it stood by its staff and was cooperating fully with investigation.</p>
<p>SAP acted quickly to ease shareholder concerns about the probe, saying in a statement that the company's chief executive would make a &quot;comprehensive statement&quot; about the affair at a shareholder meeting scheduled for Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is still no reason to doubt the reliability and confidentialty of SAP employees that have access to insider information,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Based on information from prosecutors, SAP said the investigation involves a routine examination of all employees and divisions that have access to relevant information.</p>
<p>&quot;That means there are currently no investigations targeting particular people,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>Investors became nervous after the news of the probe hit markets early Monday, and SAP's DAX-listed preferred shares fell as much as 5 percent. But the shares rallied in a booming bourse session and closed up 3.10 marks ($1.80) at 324.50 ($188), a rise which still lagged behind the broader market.</p>
<p>&quot;This does have an impact on sentiment, at least in the short term. After all, people don't like to think of prosecutors in the boardroom,&quot; said Josh Waiblinger, assistant vice president of equities at Frankfurt's BHF Bank.</p>
<p>But if its past is anything to go by, SAP, whose R/3 business software is used to keep track of purchasing, manufacturing and sales data, will bounce back fast.</p>
<p>SAP's stock market record has been meteoric -- it has tripled in value since early 1995, when news that its was to join the DAX fanned a flurry of buying interest.</p>
<p>The biggest blip, and the focus of the insider probe, came after news last October of an unexpected slowdown in third quarter growth. Then, SAP's shares fell by a quarter, but have risen to new record highs since.</p>
<p>The Federal Securities Trading Supervisory Authority, the centre of Germany's crackdown on insider deals, began an investigation into the price drop and found enough evidence to pass on the case to proseuctors.</p>
<p>&quot;The investigation is looking at the use of insider information in the trading of shares,&quot; prosecution spokesman Job Tilmann said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is probably the most serious case we have seen here,&quot; said supervisory authority spokesman Juergen Oberfrank.</p>
<p>The authority said more than 100 &quot;primary and secondary insiders&quot; were named in the initial probe -- the first category implies staff at SAP and banks and the second their relatives or friends -- making it one of the largest it has ever handled.</p>
<p>&quot;But we expect that this number will fall as time goes by,&quot; Oberfrank added.</p>
<p>An SAP spokesman said the company provided documents to the authority in October.</p>
<p>Insider dealing was outlawed in Germany in 1994 as part of a drive to clean up the financial markets and make them more attractive to international investors.</p>
<p>The maximum punishment for insider trading is five years in jail, but authorities so far have stuck to fines.</p>
