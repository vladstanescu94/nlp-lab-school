<p>Computer and video game software group Gremlin Interactive said on Wednesday it planned to float on the London Stock Exchange in July, with the group being valued at between 45 and 55 million stg.</p>
<p>Gremlin said it hoped to raise about eight million stg from the placing, and would use the proceeds to expand its production of games from between six and eight games a year to 15 within a couple of years.</p>
<p>The group makes games for PC CD Rom, for dedicated games consoles such as the Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn and Nintendo 64.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to be acquisitive going forward, post flotation,&quot; joint chief executive Ian Stewart said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be looking for companies who will complement what we are doing now and with management who have a commercial attitude.&quot;</p>
<p>Stewart said although the flotation would allow Gremlin to take advantage of the fragmentation in the industry, he expected organic growth from within the group.</p>
<p>Gremlin said it earned pre-tax profits of 2.5 million stg from sales of 11 million stg in the nine months ended April 30, 1997. Stewart did not comment on current year profit forecasts.</p>
<p>The group said it had completed contracts to move to a new building in Sheffield containing a state of the art motion-capture studio, which is designed to optimise the realistic appearance of its characters in the computer games.</p>
<p>Stewart said he believed some of his motion-capture facilities were unique ahead of Steven Spielberg's Dreamwork studios, which will be next to acquire similar capabilities.</p>
