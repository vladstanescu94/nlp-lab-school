<headline>IPO VIEW-Underwriters throw in the towel for now.</headline>

<p>The assault on U.S. stocks that has crushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average has hobbled initial public offerings, leaving activity at a virtual standstill and underwriters throwing up their hands.</p>
<p>&quot;You won't see any money here until the broader market settles down,&quot; said Vincent Slavin of Cantor Fitzgerald. &quot;People are using their money to support the deals they bought last month, not throwing it away on new deals.&quot;  </p>
<p>Two deals that could show promise next week are Accelgraphics Inc and Onsale Inc, analysts said, but premiums could be razor-thin.</p>
<p>&quot;I would caution that any expected opening premiums are considered fleeting at best ... looking good means not breaking issue next week with market conditions what they are,&quot; said David Menlow, president of IPO Financial Network, based in Springfield, N.J.</p>
<p>A deal &quot;breaks issue&quot; when it falls below its IPO price.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's not much aftermarket sponsorship for stocks that are financially unproven now. People are really stepping up to the plate for secondary offerings now,&quot; Menlow said.</p>
<p>San Jose, California-based Accelgraphics makes 3-D graphic software. Cowen &amp; Co is the lead underwriter of the 2.6 million share offering, to price between $10-$12 each.</p>
<p>Electronics retailer Onsale Inc plans to offer 2.8 million shares at $8 to $10 each.</p>
<p>Another deal that could spark interest is BEA Systems Inc, but some doubt its long-term outlook.  </p>
<p>&quot;Why buy a company that's never made any money, especially in such a sloppy tech atmosphere?,&quot; one trader asked.</p>
<p>BEA has posted net losses since its inception, according to its prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It lost $17.7 million in the fiscal year ended January 31, 1996 and $88.7 million in the fiscal year ended January 31, 1997. The company also had a total deficit of $107.3 million at January 31, 1997, the prospectus said.</p>
<p>Stocks have been battered by fears the Federal Reserve may be embarking on a cycle of interest rate hikes, which could slow the U.S. economy and cut into corporate profits.  </p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 608 points, or 8.5 percent, from its March 11 high of 7085 to its Thursday close at 6477. Friday the market recovered somewhat, with the Dow recovering 48.72 to 6526.07.</p>
<p>Three companies went public last week with only Gulf Island Fabrication Inc showing strength. One underwriter said the uncertainty ahead of the release of the employment report on Friday kept many market players on the sidelines.</p>
