<p>Microsoft plans to hire 3,600 people in the United States in the coming year, expanding its U.S. workforce by nearly 19 percent, company executives said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Microsoft's chief operating officer, Robert Herbold, told reporters at a briefing the company added 2,529 workers in the fiscal year that ended on June 30, ending the year with slightly more than 22,000 workers worldwide.</p>
<p>Company spokesman John Pinette said the plan comprised 800 hires to replace departing workers, 2,000 for positions at the company's suburban Seattle headquarters, and 800 for sales, service and marketing offices around the country, where the company employs nearly 15,000.</p>
<p>Herbold did not specify any plans to add additional positions outside the United States.</p>
<p>But he said Microsoft saw limits to its growth in the Seattle area -- and not only in the number of buildings it could add in Redmond, Washington, where the company's construction cranes dominate the skyline.</p>
<p>He said the company was beginning to see a shortage of high-quality software developers in the United States and was already looking overseas to countries such as Ireland, India and China.</p>
<p>&quot;The center of the universe for the software business is the West Coast, up through Seattle,&quot; Herbold said. &quot;We should be proud of that. We want it to remain that way. On the other hand, we have to be realistic. ... Finding enough software developers in the United States is difficult, and we have to be looking outside the country. We already are.&quot;</p>
<p>Microsoft's European manufacturing and distribution center is in Dublin, where Herbold sees potential for future hiring. But to improve efficiency, the company shrank its manufacturing staff by 92 workers over the last nine months, he said. It also eliminated 47 jobs at its manufacturing center in Humacao, Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>The company is also outsourcing more and more of its work, Herbold said.</p>
<p>Herbold described Microsoft's interactive media division, which includes high-profile projects such as the Microsoft Network online service, as still &quot;an experiment&quot; and &quot;not yet a business.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We put down projections when we think it will be making money,&quot; he said. &quot;But the one thing about this area that is certain is that uncertainty rules.&quot;</p>
<p>He said profits in the emerging business could soar when 50 percent of the nation's households were hooked up to the Internet, which he said would create an &quot;inflection point.&quot; He said it was possible that point could be reached in 2001.</p>
