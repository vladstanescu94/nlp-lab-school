<p>Two of Europe's biggest business publishers have been making slightly different noises recently about electronic distribution of their information.</p>
<p>Anglo-Dutch Reed Elsevier and Amsterdam-based Wolters Kluwer both provide &quot;must-have&quot; information which professionals such as lawyers, tax advisers, scientists and doctors need to do their jobs.</p>
<p>Both see high-quality editorial &quot;content&quot; as their core strength but both expect steady growth in electronic publishing which currently accounts for about a fifth of their revenues.</p>
<p>In many respects their views on future developments in the professional publishing markets coincide.</p>
<p>But while electronic publishing and Internet-based systems in particular seem to be an article of faith for Reed Elsevier, Wolters Kluwer appears to be taking a more relaxed stance.</p>
<p>Analysts who follow both companies say the difference in emphasis is explained partly by differences in their markets and partly by different management visions of the way forward.</p>
<p>Reed Elsevier, reporting interim results last week, gave a full account of its recent electronic publishing initiatives.</p>
<p>In May it signed a strategic agreement with Microsoft on Internet-based publishing and it has also set up its own research and development centre in Cambridge, Massachussets.</p>
<p>R&amp;D spending on major electronic publishing projects jumped 40 percent to 28 million sterling in the first half of 1997.</p>
<p>Wolters Kluwer, which absorbs development spending as part of normal operating costs, said it was continuing efforts to store its information in &quot;medium-neutral databases&quot; so that it can be distributed rapidly by any means which customers want.</p>
<p>Chairman Cor Brakel told Reuters that Wolters Kluwer was excited about the new opportunities offered by electronic publishing but was not trying to force the pace at which new media were adopted by customers.</p>
<p>Brakel said Wolters Kluwer had been using electronic media such as computer disks and CD-ROM since the early 1980s and had found some markets took to new media more quickly than others.</p>
<p>&quot;In Germany electronic publishing products are not really sought by the market. We tried a few times but the Germans are not interested, they love (printed) folio material,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Brakel said Wolters Kluwer was currently helping some key customers hook up to the company's database and integrate its contents with their own internal information networks.</p>
<p>A guiding principle for Wolters Kluwer, he said, was not to invest too heavily in software development and to buy in off-the-shelf solutions wherever possible.</p>
<p>Reed Elsevier co-chairman Herman Bruggink said last week his company also sought to outsource software development as far as possible but had set up the Cambridge facility because it needed to develop some &quot;cutting-edge, Web-based technology&quot; itself.</p>
<p>Analyst Jeff Meys at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett said some of Reed Elsevier's early electronic publishing ventures were reactive and often prompted by initiatives from competitors.</p>
<p>More recent projects, such as the Science Direct on-line service, showed a more pro-active approach, he said.</p>
<p>Meys said Wolters Kluwer was betting that in a world of open communications systems, or sufficiently competitive proprietary systems, it would not have to invest heavily in distribution.</p>
<p>He said this seemed a reasonably safe assumption for the time being but added: &quot;Things are changing quickly out there and you must always be ready for change.&quot;</p>
<p>Andre Moons of ING Barings said Reed Elsevier had a more ambitious strategy in electronic publishing, illustrated by its plans in Britain to combine on-line information about real estate with a facility for carrying out on-line business deals.</p>
<p>Wolters Kluwer, he said, had chosen instead to focus more on producing authoritative content, believing it would in any case have access to enough distribution channels.</p>
<p>Happy to use third-party distributors, Wolters Kluwer has recently been talking to competing U.S. on-line legal services operated by units of Reed Elsevier and Thomson Corp about carrying content from Wolters' tax publishing unit CCH.</p>
