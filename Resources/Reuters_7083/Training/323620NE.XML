<p>Borland International Inc executives said they are finalizing plans for a &quot;strategic turnaround&quot; aimed at returning the software firm to profitability in fiscal 1998 beginning in April.</p>
<p>But chief executive officer Delbert Yocam, who joined Borland on December 2, said the turnaround's success will depend on the successful rollout of new products in the next few quarters, the realignment of Borland's cost structure and starting some new revenue-generating programs.</p>
<p>He added Borland has &quot;enormous potential to succeed in the dynamic client/server and Internet/intranet marketplaces.&quot;  </p>
<p>Yocum made these comments in a statement with the release of Borland's third quarter 1997 financial report in which Borland reported revenues fell to $36.8 million from $55.3 million in the year ago quarter. Its net result was a loss of $0.81 a share, which compares with a profit of $0.03 a share. Borland had warned investors in December it expected a loss in this range.</p>
<p>Borland said the loss was due partly to not shipping any new products in the quarter and slowing sales of existing products, which it said likely happened because customers are anticipating Borland's upcoming product releases.  </p>
<p>The net loss includes restructuring charges and one-time acquisition costs from acquiring Open Environment.</p>
<p>Restructuring measures it took in October reduced Borland's corporate headcount by 25 people, or about 15 percent.</p>
<p>Paul Emery, vice president of finance and chief financial officer, said that, in the fourth quarter, &quot;we expect to finalize our analysis and planning in preparation for a strategic turnaround, which we expect to initiate during the first quarter of fiscal 1998.</p>
