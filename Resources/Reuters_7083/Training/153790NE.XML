<title>USA: Bay Networks taps Intel executive as new chairman.</title>
<headline>Bay Networks taps Intel executive as new chairman.</headline>
<dateline>SANTA CLARA, Calif.</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bay Networks Inc. said Wednesday it named long-time Intel Corp. executive David House as Bay's chairman, president and chief executive officer, replacing Paul Severino, the current chairman and acting CEO.</p>
<p>House most recently served as general manager of a multi-billion dollar Intel unit that produces computer chips for powerful office computers.</p>
<p>Severino, who remains a director of the company and is expected to play an important role in defining technology strategy, was named acting CEO only two weeks ago after the resignation of Andrew Ludwick.</p>
<p>Severino praised House for his 30 years of management experience, deep knowledge of the computer industry and marketing skills.</p>
<p>&quot;As one of the key architects of Intel's phenomenal success, David House is a proven leader in the computer industry,&quot; Severino said.</p>
<p>The news helped the computer network product maker's stock rise $2.125 to $20.50 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange trading, lifting off its 52-week low, as analysts said the move could strengthen the company.</p>
<p>&quot;It's quite a positive,&quot; said Bear Stearns networking analyst Eric Blachno of the decision. &quot;It's good to know the company is not going to be rudderless.&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwick had been CEO of Bay Networks since the company was formed as a result of a 1994 merger between Wellfleet Communications Inc. and Synoptics Communications Inc.</p>
<p>Under Ludwick, Bay had disappointed investors by failing to keep pace with other leading network companies like Cisco Systems Inc. and 3Com Corp., which have seen explosive growth in recent years, fuelled by the rise of the Internet, while Bay's results have stagnated.</p>
<p>Ludwick resigned two weeks ago from the company, following several months of speculation that he planned to leave.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts had complained that the company suffered from a crisis of leadership in recent months.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to believe Bay is going to be a long-term player and one of the leading companies in its industry,&quot; said Blachno, adding that, &quot;Of course, it will take some time before the new leader maps his course.&quot;</p>
