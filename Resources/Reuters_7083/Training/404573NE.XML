<p>Sybase Inc., trying to boost sales growth, will revamp its flagship database software product and most of its other programmes this year, Chief Executive Officer Mitchell Kertzman said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The lineup will include an improved version of SQL Server System 11, the company's chief database software product, by the second or third quarter and a host of development tools to let customers more easily store and retrieve information in corporate databases, Kertzman said.</p>
<p>In the past two years, Sybase has been struggling because of increasing competition form its traditional rivals Oracle Corp. and Informix Corp., as well as a new competitor, Microsoft Corp.</p>
<p>Kertzman during the past year has trimmed Sybase's product lines and cut hundreds of jobs to focus the company on its core database business.</p>
<p>&quot;Our customers wanted a symphony and we were giving them a lot of jam sessions&quot; with unrelated software product lines, Kertzman said at an investment conference.</p>
<p>To counter rivals and grow the company's core business, Sybase, based in Emeryville, Calif., plans to release a test version soon of an improved System 11, code-named 11G, Kertzman said.</p>
<p>The programme, likely to be released in the second or third quarter, will have better performance in so-called parallel systems -- a feature to take on Informix, which replaced Sybase as the No. 2 database vendor in 1996.</p>
<p>Sybase also will release this year a product code-named &quot;Jaguar,&quot; a so-called transaction server that helps customers more easily retrieve data from databases, Kertzman said.</p>
<p>Sybase stock rose 62.5 cents to $16.625 on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>The technology investment conference was hosted by Robertson Stephens &amp; Co.</p>
