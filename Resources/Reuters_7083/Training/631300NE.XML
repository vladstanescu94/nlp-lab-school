<p>Lotus Development Corp. President Jeff Papows said Monday that the commercial future of the Internet lies in billion-dollar transactions between businesses, rather than in sales to consumers.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of buzz in the Internet is creating some misconceptions. Most of the discussion and most of what you read about is about retail. But I don't think that's really where it's at,&quot; said the top executive at the Cambridge, Mass.-based software maker.</p>
<p>Lotus Development, which helped pioneer office software a decade ago with its Lotus 1-2-3 series of products, is a subsidiary of International Business Machines Corp.</p>
<p>In his opening keynote speech to the computer industry's Spring Comdex trade show, Papows quoted International Data Corp. figures showing the market for business-to-business electronic commerce ballooning to $150 billion by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>&quot;There would be something much closer to a $20 billion market for retail -- not insignificant, not by any means unimportant. But not the real commercial killer application of the Internet -- that's about business-to-business,&quot; he told an audience of about 3,000 Comdex attendees.</p>
<p>As an example of business-to-business innovations, Papows pointed to a collaborative link between Chrysler Corp and its suppliers which is expected to produce more than $1 billion in cost savings for the No. 3 automaker during the current model year.</p>
<p>The Lotus executive said the emergence of &quot;market-facing&quot; Internet-based corporate systems would help drive the market for office software products such as Lotus Word Pro and Microsoft Corp.'s Microsoft Word from $4 billion to $6 billion by the year 2000.</p>
<p>But Papows also warned that prospects for an applications renaissance in office software could come to nothing if industry executives fail to embrace Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Internet software language, Java, which is used to develop applications that will run anywhere.</p>
<p>&quot;The single most important catalyst enabling that shift is irrefutably Java,&quot; the executive said.</p>
<p>&quot;Java is not merely a language. It is prospectively the universal environment for an applications renaissance in our industry.</p>
<p>&quot;It is also, ladies and gentlemen, our last and our best hope for revitalised write-it-once, run-it-anywhere cross-platform solution. And if we screw this up, the way we screwed up other standards like Unix, we are all going to be enormous losers as a consequence,&quot; he added.</p>
