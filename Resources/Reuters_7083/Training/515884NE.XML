<headline>Microsoft says platform revenues up 73 pct.</headline>
<dateline>REDMOND, Wash. 1997-04-17</dateline>

<p>Microsoft Corp. said on Thursday revenues in the third quarter from platform products such as the Windows operating system rose to $1.68 billion, a 73 percent increase over the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>Revenues from applications and content in the quarter ending March 31 rose 24 percent to $1.53 billion, the company said in a statement detailing its earnings.  </p>
<p>Microsoft also said its cost of revenues dropped to 9.3 percent of revenues from 13.4 percent in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Chief financial officer Mike Brown said in an interview that he did not expect costs to decline much more and said they could fluctuate somewhat in the future, particularly with increased marketing costs in the December quarter.</p>
<p>Microsoft reported total cash and short-term investments of $9.09 billion at the end of the quarter, down slightly from $9.16 billion at the end of December 1996.  </p>
<p>Brown said Microsoft had spent some cash to buy back shares, and he said the figure had been artificially inflated in December by proceeds of a preferred stock offering.</p>
<p>Microsoft's &quot;unearned&quot; revenues, deferred for recognition at a later date, rose to $1.29 billion from $1.01 billion as of Dec. 31, primarily because of the way the company accounts for sales of Windows and Office.</p>
<p>Microsoft said its OEM revenues -- from manufacturers who pre-install Microsoft products -- rose to a record $960 million in the latest quarter, up 52 percent over the year-ago period.</p>
<p>Sales of finished goods in the United States and Canada rose 51 percent to $938 million, while European sales rose 44 percent to $799 million. Sales in other markets rose 29 percent to $511 million, with sales particularly strong in Japan.</p>
<p>Windows NT Server revenues more than doubled over the year-ago quarter, Microsoft said, without providing details.</p>
<p>Sales and marketing expenses fell to 23.4 percent of revvnues from 31.1 percent in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>Research and development expenses rose 35 percent to $492 million.</p>
