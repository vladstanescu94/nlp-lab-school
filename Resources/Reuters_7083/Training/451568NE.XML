<p>Microsoft Corp and China's Legend Group signed on Tuesday a software licensing agreement that officials of the two companies said could be worth 100 million yuan ($12 million) to Microsoft over the next two years.</p>
<p>The agreement licenses Legend, China's leading personal computer manufacturer, to pre-install Microsoft's Chinese language Windows 95 software in Legend personal computers.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the most significant agreement Microsoft has signed in the People's Republic of China,&quot; said Charles Stevens, Microsoft vice president, Far East.</p>
<p>Stevens and other Microsoft officials told reporters at the signing ceremony that licensing fees would be linked to Legend's sales though they declined to give further financial details.</p>
<p>Legend officials said the company sold 200,000 personal computers in China last year and has set a target of 400,000 this year.</p>
<p>Chinese government officials have estimated that 1.8 million personal computers were sold in China overall last year.</p>
<p>Legend Group controls the Hong Kong-listed Legend. Legend officials said the income from the personal computers sold under the agreement with Microsoft would be largely reflected in the results of the Beijing operations.  </p>
<p>The Windows 95 software to be installed in the Legend computers employs the simplified Chinese characters used in mainland China.</p>
<p>The two companies described their agreement as part of a strategic partnership that pointed to further cooperation in design in future.</p>
<p>Executives of the two companies and Chinese government officials hailed the agreement as part of Beijing's efforts to protect intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>The United States withdrew threatened trade sanctions against China in June last year after winning commitments to stamp out copyright piracy.</p>
<p>Washington had been pressing for Beijing to take decisive action to comply with an accord on intellectual property rights signed in 1995.</p>
<p>Chinese officials attending the ceremony hailed the pact between Legend and Microsoft as a sign that Beijing intended to enforce intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>&quot;This shows the Chinese government's resolve to protect intellectual property rights,&quot; said Yu Zhongyu, chief engineer at the Ministry of Electronics Industry.</p>
