<p>Novell Inc said Thursday it will cut its workforce by about 1,000 employees, or 18 percent, and expects a third quarter operating loss.</p>
<p>The company said in a statement that it is making the adjustments in response to competitive pressures in the small network market, adding that it will have about 4,800 workers after the layoffs and will be a more streamlined operation.</p>
<p>The job cuts will result in a one-time third quarter restructuring charge of between $25 million and $35 million.</p>
<p>The company said it expects to post a third quarter operating loss due to restructuring its distribution channel.  </p>
<p>The company said it will reduce product inventories in its distribution channels in the third quarter.</p>
<p>A company spokesman said there is a shift in the market away from selling &quot;boxed&quot; software to selling software through licensing. Novell will not ship any of the &quot;boxed&quot; software in the third quarter as it attempts to reduce inventory levels to more acceptable levels. Not shipping the &quot;boxed&quot; software will reduce revenues in the quarter. In the second quarter revenues from &quot;boxed&quot; software was about $100 million.</p>
<p>The resulting loss of about $100 million in revenues from &quot;boxed&quot; software will be offset by revenue coming from licensed software, the spokesman said. Novell did not specify now much of a revenue shortfall it expects in the third quarter as a result of the transition, but said it will result in an operating loss.</p>
<p>Earlier Novell reported a loss for the second quarter of $14.6 million, or $0.04 a share, compared with a loss of $55.3 million, or $0.15 a share, in the year-ago period. Revenues were $273.1 million compared with $188.1 million in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected Novell to earn $0.03 a share for the second quarter, according to First Call.</p>
