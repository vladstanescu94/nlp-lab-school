<p>Oracle Corp.'s Network Computer Inc. unit said Tuesday it completed the acquisition of Navio Communications Inc. and was now poised to take on Microsoft Corp.'s WebTV with its own Web-browsing device for television sets.</p>
<p>The Oracle unit, a developer of cheap computing devices called network computers, said Thomson Consumer Electronics Inc.'s RCA unit and other electronics companies will have a Web-browsing settop box based on its technology ready for Christmas.</p>
<p>The $300 devices, based on Network Computer's so-called Enchanced TV technology, will let TV viewers pull up World Wide Web sites, send and receive electronic mail, view electronic TV program guides and eventually play online game shows.</p>
<p>The Network Computer product would compete against WebTV Networks Inc., the settop-box designer that Microsoft bought for $425 million two months ago. Each company is trying to get a say in the development of an upcoming generation of TV sets that combine video broadcast with online content.</p>
<p>&quot;Our goal is to have as many settop boxes, game consoles and television sets have the Enhanced TV software to deliver a more compelling experience,&quot; said David Limp, Network Computer director of consumer marketing.</p>
<p>Analysts estimate that there are between 300 million to 1 billion television sets in the world. Software companies could strike a huge new source of revenue if the next generation of TVs relied on their products.</p>
<p>Network Computer is a unit of database software company Oracle. It is developing cheap computers that draw their computing power from corporate networks or the Internet, and do not rely on software from Microsoft.</p>
<p>In May, Network Computer said it would buy Navio, an affiliate of Internet software company Netscape Communications Corp., to develop consumer versions of these so-called network computers.</p>
