<p>A deal under which France's Infogrames Entertainment is to buy the multimedia activities of Philips Electronics will be signed in the next few days, said Bruno Bonnell, chairman of Infogrames.</p>
<p>He told a news conference on Monday that there was a simple &quot;technical delay&quot; which was not significant for the accord as a whole.</p>
<p>Financial details of the accord, under which Philips will increase its 13.22 percent stake in Infogrames, were due to be published last month, then were due to be given at Monday's news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to sign in the next few days. The financial announcement of the operation will appear in the next few weeks,&quot; Bonnell said.</p>
<p>He also said he stuck by a forecast that Infogrames would nearly double its turnover in the year to end-June, 1997 from 1995/96's 377.2 million francs ($16.5 million).</p>
<p>&quot;There is no reason for us to change our forecast of the period's profit and turnover. The turnover should be 700 million francs. Financial analysts have a consensus figure for a profit of 40 million francs,&quot; Bonnell said.</p>
<p>Infogrames had net profit of 20.6 million francs in 1995/96, and of 10.7 million francs in the first half of 1996/97 on turnover of 304 million francs.</p>
<p>Infogrames and Philips signed a letter of intent on January 31 for Philips to transfer its multimedia publishing and distribution activities to Infogrames.</p>
<p>These activities represent turnover of some 200 million guilders ($102.9 million), according to sector analysts, but will not be consolidated in Infogrames' results until the first half of 1997/98.</p>
<p>Bonnell said he was disappointed by Infogrames' turnover in CD-Roms, which came to 86.2 million francs in the six months to December 31, 1996.</p>
<p>The slow development of CD-Roms was due to poor market penetration for multimedia personal computers in Europe, particularly in France, he said. WEM/SLA ($ = 5.831 French Francs) ($ = 1.943 Dutch Guilders)</p>
