<p>Some of the computer industry's leading spokesmen admitted on Monday that they use too many buzzwords and build products that are too complicated and not always useful in everyday life.</p>
<p>A blue-ribbon panel from Silicon Valley and elsewhere agreed that building easier-to-use products was the best way of bringing more people into the new digital world.  </p>
<p>But they said today consumers have all too often been bombarded with needless software updates while being distracted by competing software &quot;wars&quot; waged by the big computer players.</p>
<p>&quot;People do want more stability and things have to become more simple,&quot; commented Ted Waite, chairman of Gateway 2000 Inc, one of the largest direct personal computer sellers.</p>
<p>Waite said consumers have every right to be frustrated with personal computers that have become difficult to use and cost too much to maintain because of their complexity.  </p>
<p>Speaking at an annual Gartner Group computer conference, the executives said consumers, both at home and at work, were confused by a huge selection of products.  All too often it has been lost that these products were really designed to make people more productive, not less so.</p>
<p>&quot;We are tyrannized by the amount of choices out there,&quot; said Gary Fernandes, vice chairman of Electronic Data Systems Corp. &quot;The product life cycle is getting smaller and smaller.&quot;  </p>
<p>They said there has been just too much emphasis on the various competing operating software &quot;platforms&quot; available, while the market was also being hurt by software updates that in fact offer very little in useful new features.</p>
<p>As well, the industry, needs to drop the jargon and speak clearer so consumers can make proper choices.</p>
<p>&quot;We have technical clutter,&quot; said Fernandes, &quot;We speak in buzzwords and acronyms.&quot;  </p>
<p>The chairman and chief executive officer of Apple Computer Inc, Gilbert Amelio, said with only about 10 percent of the world having access to a personal computer, one of the bigger challenges facing the industry was bringing more people into the new digital environment.</p>
<p>He said the quickest way to do that was to bring to market products that really make a difference in people's lives.  He said all the attention focused on the so-called &quot;browser wars&quot; -- on whether Microsoft Corp or Netscape Communications Corp. offered better software to cruise the Internet -- was really a waste of time.</p>
<p>He said browsing was essentially an unproductive activity and companies really need to focus on making products that make the Internet a useful tool to help people find information and communicate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right now browsing has a negative productivity factor, instead of a positive one.  The question is how do we get people more productive?&quot;</p>
