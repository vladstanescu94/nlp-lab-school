<title>USA: Health Management tumbles on warning.</title>
<headline>Health Management tumbles on warning.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-11-15</dateline>

<p>Shares in Health Management Systems Inc fell more than 30 percent on Friday after the company issued a profit warning, the latest in a string from health information services companies.</p>
<p>Health Management's warning, which had its shares off eight to 14-1/8 in afternoon trading, follows profit warnings since July from companies including Cerner Corp, Medaphis Corp, HCIA Inc.  </p>
<p>But Health Management's main business, information management, makes it a relatively isolated case from others in the group, more involved with installing hardware and software, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Their problems are different,&quot; said Anthony Vendetti at UBS Securities. &quot;I believe there are specific problems with particular clients.&quot;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, investors hit other health care information services companies' stocks on Friday. Medic Computer System Inc was down 2-9/16 to 30-1/2, HBO &amp; Co slipped 3-1/2 to 54 and Cerner dipped 5/8 to 11-3/4.</p>
<p>Earlier Health Management said it expected fiscal fourth quarter ended October 31 earnings per share of between $0.15 to $0.16. The consensus analyst estimate had been for $0.22 a share, according to First Call.</p>
<p>The company said it expects fiscal year 1997 earnings per share in the range of $0.75 to $0.77 which is below the First Call consensus of $1.00.</p>
<p>Vendetti said he was not recommending buying Health Management's stock at current levels, saying he had concerns that problems the company cited with individual clients during the past quarter could &quot;snowball&quot; to other clients.</p>
