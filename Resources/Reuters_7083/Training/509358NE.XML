<headline>Bay Q3 beats consensus, receivables improve.</headline>

<p>Bay Networks Inc on Tuesday posted nil earnings per share for the third quarter because of restructuring charges, but its operating earnings beat Wall Street's tempered expectations for the period.</p>
<p>Reflecting a financial transition at the company, Bay Networks, a maker of data routers and switching equipment, said its third-quarter revenues were $512.9 million, down from $521.7 million in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>A highlight of the period was evidence that Bay had cut its accounts receivable. It said accounts receivable at March 31 were $295 million versus $321 million at June 30, 1996.  </p>
<p>During the third quarter, the company said it had income from ongoing operations of $20.7 million, or $0.10 per share. The First Call consensus had called for $0.08 per share.</p>
<p>The latest quarter brought restructuring and severance charges of $32.2 million to cover workforce cuts and facilities closings. That reduced net earnings by $0.10 a share to the break-even level.</p>
<p>In a statement, Bay Networks said its switching and remote access businesses posted increases in the March quarter, as robust demand for Internet and intranet equipment helped the company overcome typical seasonal softness.  </p>
<p>Bay said its cash position during the March quarter grew to $662.8 million, up about $43 million.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to make good progress on efforts to get our business back on track,&quot; said Dave House, chairman, president and chief executive of Bay Networks. &quot;We have seen improving fundamentals in sales, marketing and product development.&quot;</p>
<p>House took over at Bay in November, after leaving a senior executive position at Intel Corp. Bay hired David Rynne, its new chief financial officer, in January.  </p>
<p>Jospethal Lyon analyst Bert Hochfeld credited Bay with making progress in controlling inventories and introducing new products at more competitive price points during the quarter.</p>
<p>Inventories at March 31 amounted to $145.2 million, down from $239.7 million at June 30, 1996.</p>
<p>In March, for example, Bay announced a new product category called routing switches that fuse the merits of two historically distinct technologies -- routers and switches.</p>
<p>Hochfeld said the reduction in outstanding accounts receivable was &quot;a very respectable&quot; improvement. Still, he expected a more complete turnaround to take time.</p>
<p>&quot;As impatient as we are in this business, (Bay CEO House) is not going to turn this company around after only a matter of months,&quot; Hochfeld said.</p>
