<headline>Datametrics CEO, other senior execs resign.</headline>
<dateline>WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. 1996-10-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Datametrics Corp said Thursday several of its senior officers, including Chief Executive Officer Stanley Wing, have resigned after a new slate of directors took control of the company's board.</p>
<p>Daniel Ginns, president of financial advisor Belmont Capital Inc, who won the chairmanship on October 8 when the new board was elected, has been named acting chief executive.</p>
<p>In addition to Wing, other executives resigning include John Van Buren, chief financial officer; Gerald Horwitz, senior vice president administration; and Carl Stella, senior vice president manufacturing.  </p>
<p>Wing, Bernard Girma and Allen Surber all resigned from Datametrics' board of directors.</p>
<p>In addition, Datametrics said it will cut 35 jobs from its staff of 151 employees.</p>
<p>&quot;Based upon our analysis of Datametrics' business performance to date, the board of directors concluded that immediate and decisive measures were required,&quot; Ginns said in a statement.</p>
<p>Datametrics, a maker of high-speed color printers, has reported consecutive quarterly losses since its fourth quarter of fiscal 1995, which ended on October 29, 1995. The company has tried to broaden its sales beyond the defense industry into commercial markets.</p>
<p>Ginns said the management changes and staff cuts, along with new cost control measures, should help the company strengthen its core defense business while helping to reinforce its commercial product strategy, Ginns said.</p>
