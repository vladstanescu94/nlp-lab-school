<headline>US OPTIONS FOCUS/Tech stocks highlight trading.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>With the technology sector lighting up an otherwise weak U.S. stock market, several technology stock options drew heavy interest Wedensday, traders said.</p>
<p>Options on shares of Cisco Systems Inc were among the most active around, led by the June 65 calls, which traded a total of about 13,675, nearly all of which crossed at the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).</p>
<p>Cisco options also trade on the Pacific Exchange (PCX).  </p>
<p>&quot;We've had one customer in particular who's been an aggressive buyer of it,&quot; said Patrick Hamilton of LETCO, referring to the Cisco June 65 calls at the CBOE.</p>
<p>In afternoon trading, Cisco shares were up 3/4 at 65-1/8 on turnover of more than 13.8 million shares.</p>
<p>Hamilton said that in the last few sessions, an investor was a heavy seller of the Cisco June 65 calls, which drove implied volatility down to the mid-30 region by Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the low end of volatility spectrum in Cisco,&quot; he said. &quot;I think that's why we're seeing the aggressive buyer in the 65s.  </p>
<p>&quot;He probably feels that volatility is pretty low and it's a good shot,&quot; Hamilton said.</p>
<p>He added that some of the other activity in Cisco options was a spinoff of the June 65 call action, with the buyer of the June 65 calls selling some June 55 calls, for instance.</p>
<p>Other busy Cisco options included the June 55 and 60 calls, the June 60 and 65 puts and the July 65 and 70 calls.</p>
<p>In other activity, Dell Computer Corp had a couple active options as the shares rallied sharply after the company reported late Tuesday strong quarterly earnings and announced a two-for-one stock split.  </p>
<p>The Dell June 100 call traded 3,825 contracts and the June 105 traded about 3,600. The busiest put was the June 95, with turnover of nearly 2,000 contracts.</p>
<p>Dell stock surged 7-3/8 to 107 on roughly 11.8 million shares.</p>
<p>Michael Schwartz, a managing director at Oppenheimer &amp; Co, said some of the Dell June 100 and 105 call activity could be an investor or investors rolling positions up to the higher strike price.</p>
<p>&quot;They could be legging into a roll up because they're not being done as spreads,&quot; he said of the June 100 and 105 volume.  </p>
<p>Schwartz added that an investor did a 15-point spread in Microsoft Corp LEAPS (long term anticipation securities) that expire in January 2000. The January 2000 85 call traded 5,490 contracts and the 100 call traded 5,890.</p>
<p>&quot;It's an in-the-money spread so he's got a high probability that it will work out, except he's got to wait 969 days&quot; until those options expire, he said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, a buy-write on a million GTE Corp shares was done with the December 42-1/2 calls on the American Stock Exchange, Andrew Schwarz at AGS Specialist Partners said. The December 42-1/2 calls traded 10,000 contracts.</p>
