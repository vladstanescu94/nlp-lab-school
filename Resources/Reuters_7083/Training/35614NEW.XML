<p>Verity Inc Thursday said it expects to post a loss of about $1.3 million, or $0.12 a share, in the first fiscal quarter ended August 31.</p>
<p>In a statement, the provider of software tools said it expects first quarter revenues to total around $8.8 million, up from $5.5 million a year ago, but down from $10 million in the fourth quarter of last year.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are disappointed in the results for the quarter,&quot; said Verity Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Philippe Courtot.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, we are very confident in the fundamentals of our business and the potential opportunities of the emerging market for our products.&quot;</p>
<p>The company said the first quarter loss would compare with a net loss of $436,000, or $0.21 a share, for the same quarter of the prior year and net income of $350,000, or $0.03 a share, for the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Verity said software product revenues are expected to be about $7.2 million, which would represent an increase of 74 percent over the $4.2 million in software product revenues for the same quarter of the prior year and a decrease of about 13 percent compared with the $8.3 million in software product revenues for the previous quarter.</p>
<p>The company said it expects operating expenses for the first quarter will be higher than the prior quarter as a percentage of revenues, due primarily to lower revenues levels and, with respect to research and development expense, increased staffing expense related principally to product development in connection with the introduction of the company's SEARCH'97 product line scheduled for Fall 1996.</p>
