<title>USA: Fox News Channel attracts Continental, Comcast.</title>
<headline>Fox News Channel attracts Continental, Comcast.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>Rupert Murdoch, still seething over Time Warner Cable's rejection of his new 24-hour Fox News Channel, got some good news this week when the nation's third- and fourth-largest cable operators both agreed to roll out FNC to more than a million of their subscribers.</p>
<p>Although Fox is a few days away from an official announcement, sources told the Variety newspaper that Continental and Comcast will each make FNC available to about 300,000 subscribers on Oct. 7, the date the network makes its debut.</p>
<p>In exchange for the vote of confidence in FNC, Fox will pay Comcast and Continental about $10 per subscriber, the highest launch-budget fee in the history of cable. Six weeks ago, Fox TV also agreed to shell out $50 million to buy 33 percent of the Golf Channel, funnelling needed cash to the network, two of whose owners are Continental and Comcast.</p>
<p>Separately, a unit of Fox moved a step closer to acquiring New World Communications Group Inc., which operates TV stations in a dozen cities and distributes programming for network and cable operators.</p>
<p>New World said it reached a definitive agreement to merge with a unit of Fox Television in a stock swap that would value New World at more than $2.5 billion. The parties announced a tentative agreement on July 17.</p>
<p>The deal between New World and Fox is expected to allow News Corp., Murdoch's holding company, to secure a stronger place in world broadcasting by making it the biggest owner of TV stations in the United States.</p>
<p>Brian Roberts, president of Comcast Corp., said his deal for FNC envisions a rollout that will expand the 300,000 figure to about a million of Comcast's 3.5 million subscriber base over the next three years.</p>
<p>Continental executives were unavailable for comment, but other sources said the cable company's agreement will inflate the launch total to about 1.5 million subscribers by fall 1999. Continental's total is currently about 4.2 million subscribers.</p>
<p>Roberts says that despite the huge launch fee, he is limiting Comcast's commitment to less than a third of its subscriber base until the network proves its value.</p>
<p>Comcast's subscriber commitment to MSNBC, the new all-news network jointly owned by NBC and Microsoft Corp., will end up at about 2 million, he said, because of &quot;retransmission consent&quot; deals. Many of Comcast's systems agreed to buy MSNBC in exchange for being allowed to carry a local NBC-owned TV station for no extra payment.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that MSNBC is way ahead of FNC in the battle to become the top cable-news competitor of CNN. MSNBC had 24 million subscribers at its July launch, while FNC will have, at best, 12 million on Oct. 7 -- 10 million of which come from cable systems owned by John Malone's Tele-Communications Inc.</p>
<p>Long-range commitments from cable operators will propel MSNBC to 50 million subscribers by the end of the decade.</p>
