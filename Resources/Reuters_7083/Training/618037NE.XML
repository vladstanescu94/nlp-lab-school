<headline>ARTWORK SAYS ON TRACK TO PAY DIVIDEND.</headline>

<p>Belgian pre-press software maker Artwork Systems Group NV said on Tuesday it was on track to pay a dividend after a strong first half of financial 1996/97 year.</p>
<p>&quot;We can confirm the statement we made during our initial public offering (on Easdaq): Artwork combines high growth...with high profitability, which will of course mean we will be able to pay out a dividend,&quot; founding partner Peter Denoo told a news conference on results for the six months to March 31, 1997.</p>
<p>Partner Guido Van der Schueren said the dividend payout would likely be &quot;considerably more&quot; than the 30 percent of net attributable earnings promised during the IPO roadshow.</p>
<p>&quot;Our dividend strategy is to pay out the cash we don't need. We are not a bank,&quot; Denoo said, adding the company did not rule out retaining some earnings for an acquisition.</p>
<p>Current assets of 509.51 million francs at the end of the second quarter ending March 31 consisted mostly of 314 million francs in cash in hand or balances, Denoo said.</p>
<p>Revenues for the half rose 34.5 percent to 249.4 million francs. Net income rose 37.7 percent to 137.7 million. The gross margin (pre-tax income to revenues) was 88.6 percent compared with 91.0 percent in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>The strong rise of the dollar on the Belgian franc pushed the earnings growth rate in dollars down to 27 percent. Net income was $4.2 million.</p>
<p>Earnings per share for the second quarter to March 31 rose to 12.32 cents from 12.24 cents in the first quarter to December 31, 1996 and 9.91 cents in the comparable year-earlier period.</p>
<p>Artworks, like most Easdaq stocks, is quoted in dollars.</p>
<p>Van der Schueren said the results confirmed that the company's strategy of positioning itself between the low-end, desk-top publishing market and traditional high-end producers, such as Scitex of Israel, Agfa Gevaert of Belgium and Germany's Linotype Hell was paying off.</p>
<p>&quot;The high end (software) is disappearing. The price performance they offer to the market place is not good enough,&quot; he said, noting there was a continuing need for high-end applications.</p>
<p>Artworks, he said, was filling the gap, noting the company had been invited to display on six high-end application makers stands at next month's German Imprinta '97 fair, Europe's most important printing trade exhibition.</p>
