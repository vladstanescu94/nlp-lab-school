<p>The Santa Cruz Operation Inc said Tuesday it expects to return to profitibility in its fourth fiscal quarter.</p>
<p>The company said in a statement the expected return to profits was due to improvements it has made to its distribution system. SCO said its worldwide inventory in its distribution channel has been significantly reduced, providing immediate benefit to SCO in reduced distribution costs.</p>
<p>&quot;Given SCO's decreased channel inventories, we feel that efficiencies created by our restructuring and write-offs should return SCO to profitability in the fourth quarter,&quot; said Chief Financial Officer John Luhtala.</p>
<p>SCO earlier reported a net loss for its third quarter, ended June 30, of $24.63 million, or $0.67 a share, compared to profits of $3.3 million, or $0.09 a share, for the comparable year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Third quarter revenues were $31.2 million compared to $54 million in the year-ago period. Revenues were reduced by about $23 million of channel inventory reductions resulting from returns, reduced product sales and increased reserves as part of the company's distribution restructuring.</p>
