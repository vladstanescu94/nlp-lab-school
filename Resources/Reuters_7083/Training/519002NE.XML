<p>Network Computer Inc, a wholly owned Oracle Corp unit, said on Thursday that a closer relationship with Intel Corp is helping it promote a new standard of stripped-down personal and business use computers.</p>
<p>Network Computer president Jerry Baker told a news conference in Tokyo that proposals by companies such as Oracle to build computers based on totally new chip architecture had made personal computer manufacturers wary about becoming involved.</p>
<p>&quot;It took a change in our strategy...not only to use Intel architecture, but also to make a commitment to continue to explore new features in Intel development architecture,&quot; Baker said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a comfort factor that is involved,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Baker said the change in strategy will help personal computer makers jump into the so-called network computer (NC) camp because Intel chip architecture is familiar to them.</p>
<p>The supporters of network computers originally planned to use only ARM microprocessors to build the NC computers, but changed that strategy and added Intel architecture in the fall of 1996.</p>
<p>Intel publicly supported network computers for the first time on Wednesday during the Oracle Open World exhibition in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison has touted the advantages of NCs, saying they are simple, inexpensive and easy for everyone to build, while conventional PCs are &quot;expensive, complex and unreliable&quot;.</p>
<p>Big Japanese PC makers, already losing money in cut-price competition, are holding back on deciding whether to jump into the NC hardware business due to concerns of low profitability.</p>
<p>But three Japanese makers not involved in PC production -- Funai Electric, Akai Electric Co and Uniden Corp -- have agreed to make NC terminals based on Oracle's design.</p>
<p>Oracle expects NC terminals to be sold for $295 to $795 per unit, or &quot;as cheap as phones&quot;, as Ellison said.</p>
<p>Oracle, International Business Machines Corp and Sun Microsystems Inc are the three core companies promoting network computers.</p>
<p>NC terminals are expected to be launched in Japan around August, possibly by Funai.</p>
