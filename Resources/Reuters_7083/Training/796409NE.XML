<p>A computer piracy watchdog organisation accused a top Singapore compact disc maker on Wednesday of being a major player in the Southeast Asian illegal software business after a raid on its factory.</p>
<p>However, the listed company, SM Summit Holdings, denied the charge, saying it was fully aware of its legal obligations.</p>
<p>&quot;It is inconceivable, therefore, that the company would be engaged in software piracy in the manner as alleged by BSA,&quot; it said in a statement, referring to the statement by the Business Software Alliance industry watchdog.</p>
<p>&quot;The company will strenuously defend any and all allegations of impropriety in this matter,&quot; it said, accusing the BSA of convicting it before any evidence had been produced.</p>
<p>Summit said it had procedures to ensure it used no pirated material and insisted on guarantees from companies for which it packaged goods.</p>
<p>&quot;Irreparable damage has been done to the company and its business as a consequence of the BSA action,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;As a public listed company, the company is fully apprised of its responsibility to its shareholders and employees and will take all necessary steps to guard their interests.&quot;</p>
<p>The BSA was jubilant after Tuesday's 15-hour raid on Summit.</p>
<p>&quot;The pirate CD-ROM industry could come to a grinding halt in Southeast Asia following a significant raid on the CD-ROM manufacturing operations of Singapore-listed SM Summit Holdings,&quot; the BSA said in a statement.</p>
<p>Summit shares plunged nearly 38 percent on Wednesday to Singapore $0.655, down S$0.39, on news of the raid. Trading in the stock was later was suspended.</p>
<p>The raid was a major operation, involving experts from the United States, Australia and Hong Kong as well as Singapore.</p>
<p>The BSA, which groups major software publishers, said the operation began when it sued SM Summit on behalf of Microsoft, Adobe Systems Inc and Autodesk Inc, accusing it of software piracy.</p>
<p>The Singapore High Court then gave approval for the raid by the detectives accompanied by experts from the BSA and the three American companies, BSA officials told a news conference.</p>
<p>The latest BSA figures say that more than half of software programmes used in Singapore are counterfeit.</p>
<p>They say that while piracy rates have fallen in Asia as a whole -- often from very high bases -- they have risen six percentage points in Singapore, from 53 percent in 1995 to 59 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>SM Summit is one of the biggest makers and suppliers of compact discs, technically the same as CD-ROMs, in Singapore.</p>
<p>In its latest financial report, in May 1997, the company claimed a 70-percent share of the Singapore market.</p>
<p>BSA regional lawyer Lee Cross said the organisation had also sued local company FAS Disc Manufacturing (S) Pte Ltd and &quot;both actions are connected to CD-ROM manufacture, illegal CD-ROM manufacture.&quot;</p>
<p>BSA and Microsoft started to investigate SM Summit following tip-offs that the company was involved in software piracy, the lawyers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We convinced a judge to provide us with a search warrant. It allowed us to seize substantial documents,&quot; said Ron Eckstrom, Microsoft's Sydney-based lawyer.</p>
<p>He said the raid uncovered boxes of documents that could be evidence of illegality, including records of manufacturing and sale of suspected counterfeit CD-ROMS at Summit's premises.</p>
<p>The BSA statement said eight &quot;stampers&quot; used for the replication of CD-ROMs were seized during the raid, each capable of making tens of thousands of CD-ROMs. Five of them were believed to contain counterfeit software products and compilations of programmes copyrighted by BSA members, it said.</p>
