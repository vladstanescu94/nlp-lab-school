<title>USA: Embattled Informix Chairman Phil White resigns.</title>
<headline>Embattled Informix Chairman Phil White resigns.</headline>
<dateline>MENLO PARK, Calif. 1997-07-31</dateline>

<p>The chairman of database software company Informix Corp., Phil White, resigned Thursday, three months after his company reported one of the largest losses ever in the software industry.</p>
<p>Informix, which is expected to report another big quarterly loss this week, said Chief Executive Bob Finocchio replaced White as chairman. Finocchio took over the role of CEO from White last week.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that we have Bob Finocchio in place as chief executive officer, I agree with the board that the company is best served with one clear leader to take a new view of the company's direction,&quot; White said in a statement.</p>
<p>White had accepted blame for cratering Informix's sales earlier this year by placing a bad bet on a new database technology. Informix writes computer programmes that store huge libraries of vital information in corporate computer networks.</p>
<p>Under White's direction, Informix sacrificed sales of its well-established database products to push a new database that can handle multimedia. But not many customers were interested.</p>
<p>In the first quarter, Informix, based in Menlo Park, Calif., reported an unexpected loss of $140.1 million, or 93 cents a share, as revenue plunged 34 percent to $133.7 million. Wall Street expects Informix to report a loss of 24 cents a share this week, according to an analyst survey by Zacks Investment Research.</p>
<p>White and other Informix officials could not be reached immediately for comment.</p>
<p>Informix stock was down 12.5 cents at $11.3125 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
