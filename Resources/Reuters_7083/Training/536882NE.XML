<title>USA: Novell shares plunge on weak second-quarter outlook.</title>
<headline>Novell shares plunge on weak second-quarter outlook.</headline>
<dateline>PROVO, Utah 1997-04-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Novell Inc. shares plunged as much as 22 percent Wednesday after the networking software company said it would report lower-than-expected second-quarter earnings and revenue.</p>
<p>Provo, Utah-based Novell's stock fell $1.78 to $7.25 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq, where it was the most active issue. Earlier, Novell traded as low as $7.</p>
<p>After the market closed Tuesday, Novell said it expected to report revenues between $300 million and $335 million for the quarter ending April 30, far less than Wall Street expected. Novell also said it expected to report only a &quot;slight profit.&quot;</p>
<p>Wall Street expected a profit of 17 cents a share, according to an analyst survey by Zacks Investment Research. In last year's fiscal second quarter, Novell reported a net loss of $55.4 million, or 15 cents a share.</p>
<p>Second-quarter revenues will be better than the $188 million the company reported in the same period last year, but the anticipated revenue is less than the $375 million Novell reported in its fiscal first quarter, ended Jan. 31.</p>
<p>The company blamed slow sales of its networking computer programs to small businesses. In a statement announcing the shortfall, Novell provided few other details.</p>
<p>In the past two years, the company has been losing sales to rival Microsoft Corp. and its Windows NT networking software.</p>
<p>Novell's software products are still the most popular for storing, retrieving and printing documents through small corporate computer networks. But Windows NT has been gaining market share because of its ability to manage bigger, more powerful networks.</p>
<p>Eric Schmidt, who was appointed Novell's chairman and chief executive a few weeks ago, said in a statement Tuesday the company would do a thorough review and set &quot;appropriate levels for operating expenses.&quot;</p>
<p>Novell plans to report the full results May 28.</p>
