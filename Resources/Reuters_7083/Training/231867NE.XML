<title>USA: Big consumer names still shy of online advertising.</title>

<p>The big consumer brand companies are still relatively shy of advertising in cyberspace and the biggest online advertisers continue to be technology companies, executives said at a conference.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumer brands are still in the wings,&quot; said Peter Storck, group director, online advertising, at Jupiter Communications, a market research firm based in New York. &quot;We are still talking to ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Storck told a Jupiter conference that while some consumer giants are warming up to advertising on the Internet, they make up a small percentage of total advertising sold.  </p>
<p>He said that of total Internet advertising in the third quarter this year, computer and Internet-related companies spent 54 percent of the $66 million advertising dollars, which is down slightly from 60 percent in the second quarter.</p>
<p>The top 10 advertisers in the third quarter were all technology companies, led by Netscape Communications Corp, then four Internet search engines, Yahoo!, Infoseek Corp and Excite Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;What are the big brands waiting for?&quot; Storck asked, then explained that the big consumer brand name companies are waiting for more standardized measurement and auditing data.  </p>
<p>Storck also said advertisers also want more research that allows them to compare the effectiveness of the online medium, and consistent ad rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Is this medium any more accountable?&quot; said Judy Black, a senior partner at Bozell Inc, the big advertising agency. &quot;There still is an issue of measurement.  Many companies still have different ways of measuring.&quot;</p>
<p>Storck pointed out that in the recent quarter, automotive companies made up five percent of Internet advertising and other various consumer companies were 15 percent of online ads.</p>
<p>Jupiter expects total online advertising spending to exceed $300 million this year and reach $5 billion in 2000.</p>
