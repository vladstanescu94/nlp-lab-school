<p>Teachers' Retirement System of Louisiana said Monday it has filed a class action suit on behalf of those who purchased the common stock of Micro Warehouse Inc between March 20, 1995, and September 27, 1996.</p>
<p>The complaint charges Micro Warehouse with misrepresenting financial information.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not comment on pending litigation,&quot; said Micro Warehouse spokeswoman Melinda Levino.  </p>
<p>The suit was filed Friday in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, a statement from Teachers' Retirement System said.</p>
<p>On September 30, 1996, Micro Warehouse announced it had accounting errors principally relating to amounts due from suppliers and vendors for defective inventory, stock rotation and price protection, and that such errors would make the company likely to restate its financial results for 1994 and 1995, a statement issued by the plaintiffs said.  </p>
<p>As a result of having to restate its financial results, the company reported that it was likely to incur a charge of about $18 million after tax, plaintiffs say.</p>
<p>On October 15, 1996, the company reported that it will restate its financial reports for 1994 and 1995 and that its 1993 financials may also need to be restated, and that the total charge for all periods would be about $28 million, plaintiffs say.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the issuance of a series of false and misleading financial statements, the price of Micro Warehouse's stock was artificially inflated during the class period,&quot; plaintiffs said.</p>
<p>Teachers' Retirement System of Louisiana said it purchased over 123,000 shares of the company's common stock during the class period.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be able to develop the exact damages through expert analysis as the case moves on,&quot; said plaintiff's lawyer Sherrie Savett of the Philadelphia firm Berger &amp; Montague.</p>
