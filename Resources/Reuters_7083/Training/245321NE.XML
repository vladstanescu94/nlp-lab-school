<p>Maxis Inc said on Tuesday it expects financial results for the third fiscal quarter ending December 31, to be below current analysts' estimates, with revenues possibly falling below the third quarter of last fiscal year.</p>
<p>In a statement, the company attributed the forecast to lower than expected affiliate revenues and a delay in the introduction of SimCopter, the company's first 3-D Sim product. SimCopter began shipping on November 18 in the U.S. and has not yet begun shipping internationally.  </p>
<p>&quot;The delay in shipment of SimCopter caused Maxis to miss a portion of the holiday buying season,&quot; said Sam Poole, Maxis' president and chief executive officer. &quot;Even incremental delays in the shipment of a product during the crucial selling season can cause significant shortfalls in revenue and earnings. Despite the late holiday shipment, retail sales for SimCopter, as well as our other new products, has been good and we expect continued reorders.&quot;</p>
<p>According to First Call, Maxis was expected to report a profit of $0.41 a share for the third quarter. In the year-ago quarter, Maxis earned $0.31 a share on revenues of $20.1 million.  </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Maxis said the delay was partly due to an incident of sabotage involving the SimCopter product (Corrects from the delay having nothing to do with the SimCopter product).</p>
<p>According to published reports, a programmer inserted scenes of men kissing each other into the computer game that become visible on certain days.</p>
<p>She said Maxis has developed a &quot;patch&quot; for the game that is available on the company's Web page and will ship corrected copies of the game to customers on request.</p>
