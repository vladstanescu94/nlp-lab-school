<dateline>DENVER 1997-06-26</dateline>

<p>Microsoft Corp. said Thursday it has formed a joint venture with First Data Corp. to allow companies to send bills and receive payments from consumers via the Internet.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.</p>
<p>The service, called MSFDC, will be the first of its kind to provide an end-to-end system for electronic presentation of bills, Microsoft said.</p>
<p>Field tests of the service with banks and billers will start this summer and it is to be introduced early next year.</p>
<p>&quot;MSFDC is an important part of Microsoft's strategy to further electronic commerce on the Internet,&quot; said Bill Gates, chief executive officer of Microsoft.</p>
<p>The venture will also allow users to pay creditors who do not present their bills electronically. This service enables financial institutions to increase the feature content of their home-banking services while lowering the cost.</p>
<p>The venture, based in Denver, will have its own management, sales and marketing team. The board of directors includes representatives from both Microsoft and First Data.</p>
<p>Microsoft and First Data have formed an advisory board to help evaluate customer needs, develop products and services, and satisfy regulatory and information-security requirements.</p>
<p>Founding members of the advisory board include leading financial institutions, American Express Co., BankAmerica Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., Citicorp and Wells Fargo.</p>
<p>Industry groups include the American Gas Association, representing gas utilities, Edison Electric Institute, representing electric utilities and U.S. Telephone Association.</p>
<p>Microsoft stock fell 87.5 cents to $129.56 on Nasdaq in early afternoon trading. First Data rose 25 cents to $42.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
