<p>The business traveller faced with a sudden overseas assignment has a growing number of ways to break the language barrier.</p>
<p>One of the most sophisticated comes in a recently introduced product from Learning Co. Inc. which teaches basic language skills with an interactive computer programme allowing the user to talk his or her way through common travel situations.</p>
<p>It is available now in Spanish and French and will soon be marketed as well in German, Italian and Japanese.</p>
<p>The CD-ROM product called &quot;Travel Talk&quot; is designed for use with Windows 95 or Windows 3.1 on systems with voice capabilities and a microphone.</p>
<p>&quot;It simulates complete tasks. You might, for instance, catch a cab, ask to go to a restaurant, order a meal, and the characters on the screen respond,&quot; said company spokesman Rob Linder.</p>
<p>If you order coffee the figure on the screen brings you a cup. If you ask the hotel desk clerk to pay your bill with a credit card, the simulated desk clerk on the screen responds accordingly.</p>
<p>The product, which the company said has been selling well, is designed for basic conversational skills -- enough to get a stranger through customs, around a city and in and out of various common situations.</p>
<p>The company also markets a deeper and more detailed language product series called &quot;We Learn to Speak.&quot; The Travel Talk product is available at retail stores in North America and internationally, and sells for from $54 to $60.</p>
<p>For the traveller in an even bigger hurry, there is another product that requires no more skill than finger pointing.</p>
<p>Called Kwikpoint, it is a laminated suitcoat pocket-sized accordion fold card with dozens of images in more than 40 categories. At a loss for words but hungry for an ice cream cone? point to the picture of one in the box marked &quot;snacks/sweets.&quot;</p>
<p>Camera film, embassies, gambling casinos, tow trucks and copying machines are illustrated along with cigarettes, sun tan lotion, barbers and dentists.</p>
<p>The product sells for under $5 and is available at book and map stores. Its developers say 200,000 of the Kwikpoints have been sold and it is standard issue for the U.S. Marine Corps.</p>
<p>It has been on the market for about five years and is now in its second version, which is larger than the first.</p>
