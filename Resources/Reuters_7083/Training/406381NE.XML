<p>NOTE: Full company name Computer Language Research Inc.</p>
<p>(a) In June 1995, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Electronic Form Systems Incorporated (&quot;EFS&quot;).  The operating results of EFS have been treated as discontinued operations.  </p>
<p>Results for both 1996 and 1995 were adversely affected by the Company's aggressive acquisition program.  During this two-year period the Company completed 12 acquisitions, eight of which were made to enhance Rent Roll's business, with the remainder made for the Fast-Tax business.  Effects of these acquisitions have adversely distorted reported performance and may span more than one year before more normalized operating results become evident.  The more important of these effects include charges for in-process R&amp;D costs, amortization of purchase price, deferral of revenue, lost revenue and additional expense incurred during the assimilation period, and increased product development costs for maintenance and integration of acquired products.  All of these items contributed to operating results in 1996 and 1995.  The effect of all of these items, offset by the $1.5 million improvement in operating results from the bank and accounting tax businesses, accounts for virtually the entire $7.6 million decline in income from continuing operations before taxes between 1996 and 1995.</p>
