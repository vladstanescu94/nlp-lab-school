<title>USA: WIZ repositions, sees year loss.</title>
<headline>WIZ repositions, sees year loss.</headline>
<dateline>SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, Calif. 1996-11-11</dateline>

<p>Wiz Technology Inc said Monday it plans to reposition its business, resulting in about a $3 million writeoff in the fourth quarter and an estimated loss of more than $2.5 million for the year.  </p>
<p>WIZ said the move is meant to help the transition of its core business to Intranet sales, away from publishing and marketing budget software.</p>
<p>In announcing the change, the company said it does not expect to meet an extended November 13 deadline for filing its annual report.</p>
<p>As a result, the company said, trading of its stocks will likely be halted November 14.  WIZ said it plans to file its annual report within seven to 10 days after that date.  </p>
<p>WIZ shares closed Friday at 2-1/2.</p>
<p>WIZ said the estimated $3 million in asset write-offs include charges to software development, inventory, accounts receivable and fixed assets.  The losses are expected on revenues of between $7 to $8 million, the company said.</p>
<p>Despite the loss, the company is in &quot;sound financial condition&quot; and has enough capital and liquidity to meet the ongoing operations for the foreseeable future, said Chief Financial Officer Richard Nance, who was appointed in September.  </p>
<p>The company said it believes focusing its business on the sale of Intranet systems will be commercially successful.</p>
<p>&quot;The company believes revenues generated from this concept will be realized in the first half of fiscal 1997,&quot; Nance said, but he added that &quot;no assurances can be provided at this time.&quot;</p>
