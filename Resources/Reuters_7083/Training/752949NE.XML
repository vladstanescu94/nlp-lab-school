<p>Microsoft Corp. plans to significantly boost spending on sales, marketing and product development in the current fiscal year, a move that could crimp earnings growth for the software giant.</p>
<p>At a meeting with industry analysts, Microsoft executives also said they expected sales growth to slow in fiscal 1998, reflecting a stronger dollar and smaller contributiions from upcoming software upgrades such as the high-powered Windows NT operating system.</p>
<p>Chief Operating Officer Bob Herbold said marketing expenses would rise beyond last year's level of 9.5 percent of its $11.4 billion in net revenues, marking the first time in many years that expenses rise as a percent of revenue.</p>
<p>Microsoft, currently in a dogfight with rival Internet software maker Netscape Communications Corp., also plans to boost research and development spending to $2.6 billion from $2.2 billion in the year that ended in June.</p>
<p>Some of the increased spending would go to joint venture projects such as MSNBC's news business with General Electric Co.</p>
<p>News of the higher spending plans, coupled with forecasts of slower revenue growth, sent Microsoft stock on a wild ride, with the shares falling as low as $135.625 before recovering to close at $138, off $3.44 on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>Marketing expenses peaked at 11 percent of net revenues in fiscal 1995 when the company launched Windows 95.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to have to spend some money next year,&quot; Herbold said.</p>
<p>Microsoft is planning upgrades to both its Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems in the coming year, but revenue growth is expected to slow to 20 to 25 percent from last year's 31 percent rate, according to analysts.</p>
<p>Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Greg Maffei said he expected the dollar to continue to rise in fiscal 1998, reducing total revenues by about 5 percent.</p>
<p>Maffei said he expected overall revenue growth in the coming year to be slower than in the past two years when sales were driven by Windows 95 and the Office 97 upgrade.</p>
<p>He also said Microsoft executives did not expect next year's Windows 98 upgrade to be anywhere near the blockbuster product that its predecessor, Windows 95, was.</p>
<p>Maffei expects Microsoft to continue its stock repurchase plan in fiscal 1998 but said: &quot;I do not know and I will not say at what price.&quot; Microsoft did not buy stock in its fourth quarter because company executive felt the price was too high.</p>
<p>Microsoft, the leader in online advertising with $24.2 million spent over the past year, intends to maintain that position in fiscal 1998.</p>
<p>Microsoft Group Vice President Pete Higgins, who is responsible for selling online advertising among other duties, said he was comfortable with estimates that total advertising revenue on the Internet in calendar 1997 would approach $500 million.</p>
<p>Higgins said Microsoft would lose &quot;hundreds of millions&quot; of dollars on its interactive media ventures in the coming year, but he said losses were declining.</p>
<p>He said the company was &quot;tightening the screws&quot; to keep costs down, but he was confident the company was in all the right areas with its Microsoft Network online service, Sidewalk local entertainment product and Web sites focusing on travel, investment, autos and gaming.</p>
<p>Other business units reporting to Higgins are hardware, which generated more than $400 million in revenue last year, and reference, which generated $100 million last year through versions of its Encarta encyclopaedia alone.</p>
<p>The company has high hopes for an unusual hardware product due to hit stores in September -- a talking &quot;Barney&quot; doll that can interact with special computer software and videos.</p>
<p>Higgins said MSN, the No. 2 online service behind America Online Inc., has more than 2.3 million subscribers, and the company's MSNBC news joint venture has more than 1.2 million users each month.</p>
<p>Microsoft Executive Vice President Steve Ballmer said the company would stick with the interactive businesses even though they may continue to lose money through fiscal 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;If we do it right we'll figure out how to make money over time,&quot; Ballmer told reporters outside the meeting. He also said Internet Explorer version 4.0 was on track for release in September.</p>
