<title>USA: Graphix Zone restructuring operations.</title>
<headline>Graphix Zone restructuring operations.</headline>
<dateline>LOS ANGELES 1997-04-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Graphix Zone Inc said Thursday it reduced its full time staff to 45 from 70 and plans to shut three of its five facilities as part of a broad restruturing plan.</p>
<p>It said the restructuring will result in a one-time third quarter charge of as much as $4 million. The company also plans to take a separate write-off related to recent acquisitions of about $1.5 million.</p>
<p>Graphix expects to report a third quarter loss of around $7.5 million on revenues between $1.5 and $2 million.  </p>
<p>Other aspects of the comany's restructuring include terminating contracts not related to core products. The company has redefined its core product category to include original PC games and branded game titles.</p>
<p>Graphix expects the teminated contracts will produce an immediate decrease in operating expenses. It will either divest or eliminate the WILMA group, the music product line and the internet retail products business. WILMA will be sold through a management buyout to the group's founders.</p>
<p>To reflect these changes, the company also said it has changed its name to Ignite, effective immediately.</p>
<p>The company also also eliminated the position of chief operating officer, previously held by Norman Block. It named Chief Executive Officer David Hirschorn to the additional position of president, a position that had been held by Block. Block is also stepping down from the board of directors.</p>
<p>It said it is evaluating its financing options and that it needs to raise capital &quot;in the very near future.&quot;</p>
