<p>Fractal Design Corp said on Monday it expected to report a net loss between $0.01 per share and $0.05 per share for the fourth quarter on revenues of between $6.7 million and $7.2 million.</p>
<p>The company said lower fourth quarter results were due to lower-than-anticipated order volume and an unexpected disruption at its manufacturing and fulfillment provider. Because of the disruption, up to $2 million in customer orders were not shipped before the quarter closed, the company said.  </p>
<p>The First Call consensus earnings estimate for the fourth quarter was a profit of $0.08 per share versus a profit of $0.10 per share in the year-ago fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Fractal said its sole third-party manufacturing and fulfillment provider ceased operations unexpectedly near the end of the quarter. Although Fractal said it was able to relocate its inventory and resume manufacturing elsewhere, it realized $2 million in orders were not shipped before the end of the quarter.</p>
<p>The company said it believed it would have reported a profit for the March quarter if the orders had been shipped.</p>
<p>The manufacturer has been told to ship the remaining orders as quickly as possible, the company said.</p>
<p>As previously announced, the proposed merger of Fractal and MetaTools Inc was expected to be submitted to shareholder votes before the end of May 1997.</p>
<p>Final results were due to be announced between April 28 and May 5, Fractal said.</p>
