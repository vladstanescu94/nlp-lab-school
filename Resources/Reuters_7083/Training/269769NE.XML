<title>USA: U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS - Institution exits Informix call.</title>
<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS - Institution exits Informix call.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-12-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Big trades in an Informix Corp option highlighted trading that was largely focused on the expiration of December contracts.</p>
<p>On the American Stock Exchange, the Informix January 20 call traded about 6,050 contracts. The same option traded about 4,950 contracts on the Chicago Board Options Exchange.</p>
<p>Traders said an institution was selling the calls to exit a position.</p>
<p>&quot;Both times (on the AMEX and CBOE), the crowd took down the calls,&quot; a trader at the CBOE said.  </p>
<p>He added that the option, which was down 3/4 at two in afternoon trading, traded as low as 1-5/8.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to me like a big portfolio hedge,&quot; he said. &quot;We don't see that type of customer normally unless it's something like that.&quot;</p>
<p>Informix shares were down 55/64 at 20-57/64 on turnover of more than 5.6 million shares.</p>
<p>The trader said the stock was under pressure after Soundview Financial cut its earnings estimates for fiscal 1996 and 1997.  </p>
<p>In other activity, Conrail Inc options continued active on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange after Thursday's sweetened bid from friendly suitor CSX Corp.</p>
<p>The new bid remains below the hostile offer from Norfolk Southern Co.</p>
<p>Among the options, the January 105 call was most active, with about 5,435 contracts changing hands by afternoon. With the stock moving away from that strike price, the option lost 3/8 to 3/4.</p>
<p>The Conrail January 100 call traded 2,850 contracts and fell 3/4 to 2-1/2.  </p>
<p>The Conrail December 100 call, which expires today, traded 2,260 contracts. It lost 1-1/8 to 1/8.</p>
<p>Conrail shares, up Thursday on the revised bid, slipped 3/4 to 100 on consolidated volume of roughly 1.3 million shares.</p>
<p>Among Conrail puts, the January 95 traded 2,000 contracts and the January 100 traded about 2,175.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, a couple of WorldCom Inc options continued to see heavy trading on the Pacific Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The WorldCom January 25 call traded about 5,100 contracts and the January 22-1/2 call traded 3,920.  </p>
<p>Traders said increased takeover speculation on WorldCom led to a runup in call activity as well as a spike in volatility.</p>
<p>But they noted that the stock was not confirming the takeover speculation by rallying. WorldCom shares were up 1/4 at 22-3/8 Friday afternoon. Volume was heavy at nearly nine million shares.</p>
