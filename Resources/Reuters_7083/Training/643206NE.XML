<title>USA: Avant! extends major contract with Lucent.</title>
<headline>Avant! extends major contract with Lucent.</headline>
<dateline>SUNNYVALE, Calif. 1997-06-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Avant! Corp. said Friday that Lucent Technologies Inc., one of its biggest customers, has extended a major contract for Avant! electrical engineering software products.</p>
<p>Avant!'s chief executive, who was charged in April with conspiracy and trade secret theft, also told investors in an emotional conference call that the Avant!'s customers still have faith in him, despite a barrage of criminal and shareholder lawsuits.</p>
<p>&quot;The customers are no fools,&quot; Gerald Hsu said. &quot;They demonstrate their confidence with us. They demonstrate it in the best way -- with their pocket books.&quot;</p>
<p>Financial terms of the Lucent transaction were not disclosed. Avant! said it will supply its products to Lucent for several additional years, under a contract that was first signed in December 1994.</p>
<p>Avant!, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., writes computer programmes that help electrical engineers draw up the microscopic circuits of computer chips. Three years ago, Cadence Design Systems Inc., a cross-town rival, filed a civil lawsuit alleging that Avant! stole some of its programmes and based key products on Cadence technology. That legal battle continues.</p>
<p>On April 11, the Santa Clara, Calif., district attorney also filed criminal charges against Hsu and other Avant! executives, charging theft of trade secrets from Cadence. Avant!'s stock plunged 50 percent that day on concerns that customers would be scared away.</p>
<p>Hsu reiterated Friday that the charges are false. He also said the Lucent contract, and another &quot;major deal&quot; in the works, confirms that customers are not fleeing.</p>
<p>&quot;Our second-quarter is going extremely, extremely strong,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Avant! stock rose $3.875 to $25 before it was halted on Nasdaq before the Lucent announcement.</p>
