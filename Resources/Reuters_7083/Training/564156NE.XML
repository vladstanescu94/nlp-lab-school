<p>Prosecutors leading an insider dealing investigation which centres on German software firm SAP AG said on Tuesday that they were not only examining trade in SAP shares but also deals in related derivatives.</p>
<p>Job Tilmann, spokesman for the Frankfurt prosecutors' office, told Reuters that more than half the transactions currently under scrutiny were call and put options traded on the DTB futures and options exchange around October 23 last year.</p>
<p>Tilmann also stressed that only a small minority of those trades, which involved more than 100 people, might turn out to have been sparked by insider information. The investigation would take months, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are not 100 accused people here, just 100 people who were involved in these transactions in this period. And we expect that a small proportion of that business may show evidence of insider activity,&quot; Tilmann said.</p>
<p>On Monday prosecutors said they were investigating SAP amid allegations that a large number of its staff and associates dealt illegally in its shares in a phase of extreme price volatility in October last year.</p>
<p>More than 100 names of people involved in these transactions have been passed on to prosecutors by Germany's stock market watchdog, the Federal Securities Supervisory Authority, or BAWe.</p>
<p>SAP has stood by its staff, saying it has no reason to suspect them of misusing privileged information, but says it is co-operating fully with authorities. It is to address the issue more fully at its shareholder meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Shares in SAP, one of the most popular stocks on the German market following a rapid rise in recent years, plunged in October, losing a quarter of their value after the company released weaker than expected third quarter figures.</p>
<p>The price fall was investigated by the BAWe, which says it amassed enough evidence of dubious activity to pass on the case to prosecutors.</p>
<p>Officials at the BAWe have said this case may be the most serious since Germany criminalised insider trades in 1994.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the investor lobby group, the Association for the Protection of Small Shareholders, reacted to news of the probe by urging tougher action against insider trading.</p>
<p>Anneliese Hieke, spokeswoman for the association, told German radio that personnel at the BAWe authority should be increased &quot;at least tenfold&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Tough action must be taken,&quot; Hieke said, arguing that small shareholders suffered most when insider deals went through undetected.</p>
<p>The BAWe was established in 1995 to implement a 1994 law which banned insider trading in Germany for the first time.</p>
<p>After a slow start, the BAWe now has some 100 staff and an electronic monitoring system which allows it to assess 400,000 trades taking place in Germany daily.</p>
<p>The Frankfurt-based agency passed on 11 cases of suspected insider trading to prosecutors in the first quarter of 1997, compared with seven for the whole of 1995.</p>
<p>The maxixum penalty for insider trading is a five-year jail term but no custodial sentence has yet been imposed.</p>
<p>The highest fine, imposed earlier this year, totalled 3.6 million marks, with one million marks to be paid up front and the rest suspended pending a probationary period.</p>
<p>Shares in SAP, which took a brief deep dip on news of the investigation on Monday only to recover fast, were stable in Tuesday's bourse session. Its DAX-listed preferred shares climbed 50 pfennigs to 325 marks.</p>
