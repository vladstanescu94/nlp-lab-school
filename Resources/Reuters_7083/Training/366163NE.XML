<title>USA: Sun's JavaSoft unveils Java for DOS PCs.</title>
<headline>Sun's JavaSoft unveils Java for DOS PCs.</headline>
<dateline>INDIAN WELLS, Calif. 1997-02-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Sun Microsystems Inc's Javasoft on Monday said it had begun demonstrating a software implementation of its Java system, which it said was able to breathe new life into older personal computers.</p>
<p>The software-only implementation, which is expected to be announced as a product around Sun's second annual Java conference in April, could cost as little as around $100 and operate on 180 million older personal computers.</p>
<p>&quot;This is all about how we save the 180 million older PCs that are headed for the junkyard,&quot; Alan Baratz, president of JavaSoft, said in an interview.  </p>
<p>Baratz said the demonstration at the DEMO 97 conference in Indian Wells, near Palm Springs, was intended to show how the life of computers running Microsoft Corp's MS-DOS software and Intel Corp's Intel 486 chips or better could be extended using Java and network connections.</p>
<p>The capability, developed under a JavaSoft program which was internally dubbed &quot;Project Rescue,&quot; also provides a counter to an initiative by Microsoft, Intel, Hewlett-Packard to provide scaled-down NetPC computers.</p>
<p>The NetPC itself was announced after launch of the network computer devices being marketed by Sun and its allies.  </p>
<p>&quot;Everybody talks about the $500 Net computer or the $750 Net computer. But our notion is, you pick your price point, but say the $99 Net computer,&quot; Baratz said, referring to Project Rescue.</p>
<p>&quot;Since this is a software-only Net PC, it's clearly going to be less than $500 a pop or $1,000 a pop,&quot; he said, noting that corporations could use fully depreciated personal computers.</p>
<p>&quot;Your low-end PC becomes a modern Net computer,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The JavaSoft executive said it was too early to tell how the market would respond to the new computer devices.  </p>
<p>Java, which has been licensed by virtually every major computer system supplier since its launch in May 1995, began as an object-oriented programming language that allows developers to reuse bits of computer code to speed programming.</p>
<p>Java, which has the advantage of being able to operate on otherwise incompatible computer systems, is being expanded to include an operating system and can be used on devices ranging from data centers to cellular telephones.</p>
