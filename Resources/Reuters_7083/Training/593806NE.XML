<headline>Novell unveils new networking software.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-19</dateline>

<p>Novell Inc said Monday it introduced a software product that will make a corporate network more secure and manageable, called BorderManager.</p>
<p>BorderManager will be available in the third quarter and it includes firewall security, remote access capabilities and other security features. Pricing is not yet available.</p>
<p>BorderManager, formerly code-named Border Services, will let corporations secure the entry points where a corporate network connects to the Internet. It will also provide security internally, such as keeping payroll records from all employees except authorized users.  </p>
<p>Novell also announced the availability of Novell Replication Services, software for replicating, distributing and synchronizing information across a wide area corporate network and a corporate intranet.</p>
<p>Novell Replication Services is in beta testing now and is scheduled to ship through Novell's distribution channels this summer, with pricing announced at that time. NRS can be downloaded now from Novell's Web site.</p>
<p>Novell CEO Eric Schmidt addressed customers, analysts and press at a briefing to introduce the products at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum here, which is also a Novell customer.  </p>
<p>Schmidt said that Novell's network services offerings are very important to its future, as well as its next upgrade of NetWare, which is code-named MOAB, and will be completely Internet-ready.</p>
<p>&quot;This product is key in changing the perception of the company, and getting us to the Internet space,&quot; Schmidt said.</p>
<p>Novell has been criticized for missing the boat on the Internet and Schmidt said he is focused on turning Novell into a leading software provider to help companies embrace the Internet and to develop corporate intranets.</p>
