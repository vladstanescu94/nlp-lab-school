<p>The chief executive of Israel's Memco Software Ltd on Tuesday said his company could become a leader in the growing enterprise security software market within a few years.</p>
<p>The executive, Israel Mazin, told Reuters the company would grow by introducing new security products and by entering partnerships such as the one it has established with International Business Machines Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no market leader,&quot; he said. &quot;I think we have a very good chance to be a leader in the next few years.&quot;  </p>
<p>The fragmented enterprise data security market is expected to grow to $13 billion a year by 2000 from $5 billion in 1995, according to a report issued in December by Lehman Brothers analysts Patrick Burton and James Kavetas.</p>
<p>The analysts forecast Memco earnings would reach $0.39 per share in 1997 and revenues would quadruple from 1996 to 1998. Mazin said he was &quot;comfortable&quot; with their estimates.</p>
<p>On Monday, Memco reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.7 million, or $0.11 a share, compared with a loss of $384,000, or $0.03 a share, in the same period the year before.  </p>
<p>For the year, earnings were $3.4 million, or $0.25 a share, compared with a loss of $2.46 million, or $0.21, in 1995. About 90 percent of the company's revenues come from the United States.</p>
<p>The results exceeded expectations of the handful of analysts who cover Memco, which made its initial public offering in October.</p>
<p>Memco supplies SeOS software designed to protect open computer system servers from intruders. The company hopes to make its software the standard for the growing industry.</p>
<p>He said Memco planned to release in the second quarter both a product called Single Sign-On that eliminates the need for multiple passwords and sign-ons for computers, as well as a Windows NT version of SeOS.</p>
<p>The Tel Aviv-based company has about 120 employees, up from less than 50 a year ago, and Mazin expected to have 170 to 200 in a year.</p>
<p>&quot;We are continuing to hire more and more people, mostly in sales and marketing,&quot; he said.</p>
