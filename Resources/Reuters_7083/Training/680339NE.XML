<p>Stocks of video game software companies are poised to rise this year amid a flood of new products and strong game machine sales, some industry analysts said.</p>
<p>After hours of exhaustive research at last week's Electronic Entertainment Expo, analysts concluded there are plenty of potential video game hits in the works, which could boost video game stocks sharply before year's end.</p>
<p>In fact, this could be the best year for video game stocks after a three-year slump, analysts said. Nintendo Co. Ltd., Sony Corp. and Sega Enterprises Ltd. will sell about 15 million home video game consoles in the next 12 months, according to company forecasts.</p>
<p>That would create lots of demand for software since consumers buy five or six software titles with each console they buy.</p>
<p>&quot;This was the first E3 show in years to focus on the software instead of the hardware, which foretells a very robust Christmas for the software companies,&quot; said Lawrence Marcus at investment bank Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s it was not much fun being in the video game software business. The Sega Genesis and the Nintendo Super NES, which had been the rage among teenagers in the 1990s, had grown stale.</p>
<p>The industry did not revive until 1995 when Sony released its PlayStation console, followed in 1996 by the Sega Saturn and the Nintendo 64. The new generation of video game machines featured eye-popping graphics and sound capabilities, allowing software companies to write more realistic games.</p>
<p>This will be the year when the software industry explodes again, analysts said.</p>
<p>At E3, the video game industry's influential trade show, Electronic Arts Inc. and Activision Inc. were the &quot;buzz booths&quot; this year, Marcus said. Each demonstrated a huge slate of new products, five or six of which could be hits.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts, the biggest game software publisher, demonstrated lots of new sports games for the PlayStation. Some of the action titles were Longbow, a helicopter simulation, Need for Speed II, a car racing simulator, and Lost World, a game based on the dinosaur movie.</p>
<p>&quot;You get to be a T. Rex and chomp on people,&quot; said Keith Benjamin at Robertson Stephens &amp; Co. &quot;It was digusting. I loved it.&quot;</p>
<p>Activision, based in Los Angeles, showcased Apocalypse, a shoot-'em-up featuring Bruce Willis, Quake II, an eye-popping sequel to a best-selling action game, and Hexen II, a fantasy action game.</p>
<p>&quot;Apocalypse with Bruce Willis is going to be a big product,&quot; said Mike Wallace at UBS Securities in New York. &quot;Activision has a killer product lineup.&quot;</p>
<p>Wallace also liked Mortal Kombat IV, the newest version of the bloody fighting game for arcades. MK4, as the game is known, could boost the fortunes of Chicago-based Midway Games Inc., Wallace said.</p>
<p>&quot;Stocks I like are Electronic Arts, Activision and Midway,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts also cited GT Interactive Software Corp. as a company with a cool product lineup. GT could have two new lucrative franchises with Oddworld and Unreal.</p>
<p>The biggest disappointment of the show was Broderbund Software Inc.'s Riven, a much-anticipated sequel to Myst. Although clips from Riven featured stunning graphics and beautiful, eerie music, the fantasy puzzle game was not much different than its predecessor, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Riven looked just like Myst, and I'm convinced no one played Myst,&quot; said Benjamin. &quot;They sold a million copies (of Myst) because people wanted to show off their PCs.&quot; Riven probably will not get the same word-of-mouth as its predecessor, he said.</p>
