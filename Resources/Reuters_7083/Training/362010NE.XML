<headline>Sony says still negotiating JSkyB deal.</headline>

<p>A Sony Corp spokeswoman on Thursday denied a Japanese media report that the company could sign a contract as early as next week to take a 25 to 30 percent stake in Japan Sky Broadcasting Co, or JSkyB.</p>
<p>Japan's Kyodo news agency reported on Thursday, quoting unidentified informed sources, that Sony had decided in principle to acquire a 25 to 30 percent stake in JSkyB, which is currently a partnership between Rupert Murdoch's News Corp and Japanese publishing firm Softbank Corp.</p>
<p>Kyodo said a deal would be signed as early as next week in New York.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no change in our position that we are still negotiating the issue... We are not in a position now to say that a contract is likely as early as next week, nor have we decided an acquisition ratio,&quot; the Sony spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no such prospects now,&quot; she added.  </p>
<p>Last week, Sony president Nobuyuki Idei told Reuters that his company was seeking an active management role in the satellite TV alliance, which will bring Sony lucrative new business opportunities.</p>
<p>Idei said negotiations on its investments in JSkyB were continuing and did not comment on details, but added: &quot;We have no intention of being a silent partner.&quot;</p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp, has basically agreed to Sony having an active management role in JSkyB, Idei said in the interview with Reuters.</p>
<p>The 20 billion yen venture will launch test broadcasting in Japan in April and a full 100-channel service early next year.</p>
<p>Idei said broadcasting will provide Sony with effective distribution channels and allow the group to make coherent and strategic investments in content and hardware businesses, such as set-top boxes and base stations.</p>
<p>Kyodo reported that the deal would be signed by Idei, Murdoch and Softbank chairman Masayoshi Son.</p>
