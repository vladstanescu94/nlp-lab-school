<p>Informix Corp. solved its short-term financial woes Wednesday with a $40 million investment from Fletcher International Ltd., but analysts said the troubled software company still faces many challenges.</p>
<p>Menlo Park, Calif.-based Informix said it will use the cash infusion to help it get &quot;back on track towards profitability.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is certainly helpful,&quot; said Charles Phillips of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Co. &quot;It's a small step in the right direction but it doesn't solve all the strategic issues that are still on the table.&quot;</p>
<p>Informix, the world's second-biggest publisher of database programs, recently posted a heavy second-quarter loss and revealed some significant anomalies in the way it recorded sales. The company said last week it will restate its 1996 revenues lower by as much as $100 million.</p>
<p>Informix had been recording revenues for products shipped to distributors and resellers long before those products were sold to customers. In some cases the products were never sold.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a simple case of declining revenues,&quot; said Phillips, who said the company still faced the task of collecting on sales and cutting costs.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Informix sold 160,000 shares of newly issued series A convertible preferred stock for $40 million to Fletcher, and issued a warrant for up to an additional 140,000 shares of series A convertible preferred stock for up to $35 million.</p>
<p>The series A convertible preferred stock is convertible into common stock any time after issuance and will automatically convert into common stock after 18 months.</p>
<p>Fletcher is a privately held New York investment firm specializing in turnaround companies.</p>
<p>Some analysts said the equity investment would help allay ill-founded fears that the company could face bankruptcy. Informix's cash in hand last week was rumored to have fallen as low as $60 million.</p>
<p>Last week, the company announced plans to cut another 10 percent to 15 percent of its 4,200-person workforce in the third quarter and take an unspecified charge. In order to lay off the workers, many of whom were involved in sales, the company will need cash for severance packages.</p>
<p>The company's cash horde has dwindled as its losses have mounted. At the end of the second quarter, the company had $104 million cash on hand, down from $120 million at the end of the first quarter.</p>
<p>Informix Chairman Phil White resigned last month. He was replaced by Bob Finocchio, who a week earlier had taken over for White as chief executive officer.</p>
<p>White accepted blame for Informix's problems earlier this year after placing a bad bet on a new database technology. Under White's direction, Informix sacrificed sales of its well-established database products to push a new database that can handle multimedia. But the new database attracted few customers.</p>
<p>To return to profitability, analysts said Informix needs to cut costs and refocus its sales efforts on its core products.</p>
<p>Informix reported a loss of $120.5 million, or 79 cents a share, for its second quarter ended June 29, including a $62.1 million restructuring charge for layoffs and asset writedowns. Revenues for the quarter were $164.7 million. That loss followed an unexpected first-quarter loss of $140.1 million, or 93 cents a share, on revenue of $133.7 million.</p>
<p>Informix stock fell 6 cents to close at $9.50 on Nasdaq.</p>
