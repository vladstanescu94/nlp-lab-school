<title>USA: Wall Data shares plunge on profit outlook.</title>
<headline>Wall Data shares plunge on profit outlook.</headline>
<dateline>KIRKLAND, Wash. 1997-07-08</dateline>

<p>Wall Data Inc shares fell as much as 38 percent Tuesday after the software company said it expects second-quarter earnings that are just half of Wall Street forecasts.</p>
<p>The company also unsettled investors after it announced Monday that Chairman Jim Simpson will retire at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Shares of Wall Data fell 8-7/8 to 18-7/8 in early Nasdaq trading of 1.7 million shares, making the stock among the most active in U.S. markets. Earlier the shares traded as low as 17-1/4.  </p>
<p>For the past two year, Wall Data has had a hard time growing sales of its products, which connect networks of personal computers to mainframes. Its earnings shortfall announcement Monday marked the third time in two years that the company has reported earnings far below Wall Street expectations.</p>
<p>For the second quarter, Wall Data expects to earnings, before charges, of $0.17-$0.20 a share. Analysts expect the company to earn $0.34 a share, according to a recent survey by Zacks Investment Research.  </p>
<p>Second-quarter revenue will be about $35.5 million, up from $34.8 million a year ago, the company said.</p>
<p>Rob Owens, analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, said sales fell about $3 million short of his forecast.</p>
<p>On top of the weak earnings results and Simpson's unexpected retirement, Wall Data will take a $10.7 million charge in the second quarter to settle a shareholder lawsuit. The suit was filed two years ago, shortly after the company suffered a huge stock drop because of another earnings disappointment.</p>
<p>Some investors said the size of the settlement raised concerns about the company's integrity.</p>
<p>&quot;Normally these things get settled for a paltry amount,&quot; not millions, said one investor who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>Simpson and other Wall Data executives could not be reached for comment.</p>
