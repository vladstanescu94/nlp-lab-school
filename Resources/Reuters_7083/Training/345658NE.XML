<p>Amid a rash of companies attempting to use so-called &quot;push&quot; technology to win consumers' attention on a crowded World Wide Web, one firm is marketing the technology for a behind-the-scenes business product.</p>
<p>&quot;Push,&quot; arguably the Internet technology du jour, is a method of distributing information over the Internet so it goes automatically -- like a broadcast -- to people who have registered interest in the topic. It's often marketed as an alternative to the tedium of searching for information.</p>
<p>Quintus Corp, a Fremont, California, based maker of customer service software, recently introduced software joining push technology and so-called intranets for customer service application. Intranets are internal corporate networks based on the Internet.</p>
<p>Its &quot;ImpaQ&quot; software is designed to let key employees within a company get real-time information about customers &quot;pushed&quot; to them at vital moments from in-house databases or from partners' databases over intranets.</p>
<p>Using the information, a sales person might, for example, prevent a customer defection by resolving a problem of a missed shipment before the customer calls to complain.</p>
<p>&quot;Customer service is at the core of most (companies') challenges,&quot; Quintus President Alan Anderson said in an interview. &quot;In the future, the only thing that is going to differentiate a company is its customer service.&quot;</p>
<p>Quintus likes to cite a potential use for ImpaQ in the hotel business.</p>
<p>For example, a hotel with an intranet-to-Intranet data-sharing arrangement with an airline gets information flashed to it that a registered guest's flight arrived late. The hotel, Anderson said, could respond by being ready for the weary traveller when she arrives and prevent a wait in the check-in line and the risk of an angry guest.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the hospitality industry will subscribe to this fairly aggressively. &quot;Customer service is a problem for hotels and airlines,&quot; that both industries are already spending heavily to fix, he said.</p>
<p>Hilton Hotels Corp is a Quintus customer for its other customer service products, Anderson said. He said when Hilton officials were briefed on the product they &quot;did a back flip&quot;.</p>
<p>Another example might be a pharmaceutical firm's sales and shipping departments getting notices &quot;pushed&quot; to them the moment a pharmacy runs out of its product. The pharmaceutical firm would then be able to replenish the stock before the pharmacy has time to ponder switching vendors.</p>
<p>Privately-held Quintus, which sells other customer service and call centre software, operates in a market place populated with many vendors, the largest of which are probably Verity Inc and Clarify Inc, analysts said.</p>
<p>But the market is growing fast for all -- about 40 percent a year, Gartner Group estimates.</p>
<p>Quintus hopes to differentiate itself -- at least temporarily -- as the only customer service software seller to use push technology on private intranets, analysts said, to offer real-time pervasive customer information. Verity offers an e-mail notification service using the Internet.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very functionality driven marketplace. Quintus is the first one to come out with this sort of technology, this functionality, of making customer information pervasively available within an organisation,&quot; said Gartner Group analyst Carter Lusher, vice president and research director for customer service and support strategies.</p>
<p>&quot;What is unique is it's centred on better information flow for customer management,&quot; said META Group analyst Kurt Johnson.</p>
<p>And Quintus becomes the first company to use Push technology in a purely business-to-business purpose using closed intranets.</p>
<p>PointCast Inc has made &quot;push&quot; technology successful among consumers and professionals wanting World Wide Web-based information searched for them with certain topics then &quot;pushed&quot; to their computers. Quintus plans to make the software generally available in the second quarter of the year.</p>
