<p>Intel Corp. , the leading maker of computer chips and a technology bellwether, said Friday that revenues and net income for its fiscal second quarter will fall below expectations due to weaker-than-projected demand, particularly in Europe.</p>
<p>Revenue for the period is expected to drop 5 to 10 percent below the first quarter's $6.4 billion, while gross margin, a key measure of profitability, is forecast at under the 64 percent of the prior period, Intel said.  </p>
<p>The news took Wall Street by surprise and weighed heavily on Intel shares in third-market trading before the Nasdaq market opened.</p>
<p>Intel's stock tumbled to $145.50 from $163.766 in frenzied pre-opening activity, traders said.</p>
<p>At least one brokerage house weighed in with an immediate downgrade. Morgan Stanley cut its rating to outperform from strong buy.</p>
<p>Traders said the Intel news sapped investor confidence in other leading technology shares. Microsoft  fell to $123 from $125.875 and Dell Computer  was at $107 from $110.375.  </p>
<p>According to First Call, $2.16 per share is the consensus of 35 analyst earnings forecasts for the second quarter ending in June.</p>
<p>Intel also said second-quarter expenses are expected to be 7 to 9 percent above the $1.3 billion it recorded in the prior quarter, and second-quarter interest and other income is forecast at $170 million.</p>
<p>For the full year, research and development spending is projected at $2.4 billion, the tax rate for the year is expected to be unchanged at 35.5 percent and capital spending is put at $4.5 billion, Intel said.</p>
