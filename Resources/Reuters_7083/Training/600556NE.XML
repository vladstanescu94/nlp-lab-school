<headline>INTERVIEW-Malaysia lauds high-tech zone's freedom.</headline>

<p>By Neil Winton, Science and Technology Correspondent</p>
<p>Malaysia believes some of the world's leading companies will flock to the high technology zone it is planning because the concessions available will free them from the constraints of doing business in the west.</p>
<p>In an interview with Reuters, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Wednesday U.S. companies like Sun Microsystems and Microsoft had already signed up for the special treatment offered in the zone, called the Multimedia Super Corridor.</p>
<p>Mahathir, when asked whether Malaysia's record on censorship might not make it the ideal centre for information publication, said this charge was untrue.</p>
<p>Malaysia plans to develop the Multimedia Super Corridor in a 14 by 50 kilometre (nine-by-30 mile) zone extending south from the capital Kuala Lumpur and linking it with a new international airport and the future administrative capital of Putrajaya.</p>
<p>The first city in the zone will be Cyberjaya, where every home will have Internet access and all business transactions will be paid for with smart cards.</p>
<p>Forty-two foreign and local firms have made varying commitments to locate in Cyberjaya, including AT &amp; T of the U.S., Germany's Siemens, British Telecommunications, and Japan's Mitsubishi Corp, Sumitomo Corp and Sharp Corp.</p>
<p>Mahathir said the zone would be designed to remove all barriers to progress in the world of multimedia communications.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a total approach towards the information age. We have specific areas in which we are going to put in new laws and special policies for this place allowing easy access to foreign knowledge workers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to be very business friendly, tax incentives are going to be given, and we have a greenfield site where people can develop whatever they want to without any hindrance.&quot;</p>
<p>Mahathir was in London to promote the zone at the start of a two-month sabbatical from power. He plans to visit several more countries including Poland, Hungary and Switzerland as part of his work and rest break.</p>
<p>The freedom provided by the zone would provide unprecedented opportunities even for the most advanced western companies.</p>
<p>&quot;They (big western firms) are under certain constraints, faced by old policies, industrial age policies, industrial age laws, and usually authorities are quite resistant to change. We are accommodating all their needs and we have experience in this.&quot;</p>
<p>Malaysia has already attracted much foreign investment for industrial projects, led by Japanese firms.</p>
<p>The country hopes the zone will promote leadership in niches like the development of software and hardware, tele-medicine, and promoting electronic paperless government. Schools and universities will train Malaysians to eventually takeover from the inevitable initial influx of foreign workers.</p>
<p>But won't foreign companies be wary of government interference and censorship?</p>
<p>&quot;We have been accused of censoring our media which is absolutely untrue. We do appeal to the media to be responsible.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Local newspapers have always felt a sense of responsibility It is not censorship. Maybe you can call it self-censorship.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But in the case of the Internet, you can use the internet (freely) but if you download pornographic material....and distribute pictures all over the country, then you are breaching the local law and then of course we will have to take action.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not as a censor, but because you are actively corrupting the morals of the country.&quot;</p>
