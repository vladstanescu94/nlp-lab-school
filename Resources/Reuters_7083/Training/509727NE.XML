<title>USA: Avant! stock tumbles on charges of technology theft.</title>
<headline>Avant! stock tumbles on charges of technology theft.</headline>
<dateline>SAN JOSE, Calif.</dateline>
<text>
<p>The stock of Avant! Corp. lost nearly half of its value Tuesday, a day after the Santa Clara County, Calif., district attorney filed felony charges against the company for allegedly stealing rival Cadence Design Systems Inc. technology.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform, adding fuel to the sell-off.</p>
<p>The stock fell $12 to $12.50 on Nasdaq, where it was among the day's most active stocks.</p>
<p>On Monday, the district attorney alleged that Avant, its president and other senior officials misappropriated Cadence's Symbad, Froute, Groute, Qplace and Vsize technologies, and &quot;then used that stolen technology to develop and market competing products.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have a major publicly-traded company that appears to be founded on stolen technology,&quot; Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Julius Finkelstein said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Finkelstein said arrest warrants had been issued for all of the defendants and that bail was set at $100,000 each.</p>
<p>Finkelstein said he expected the Avant executives to surrender later Tuesday. &quot;I anticipate they will be posting bail,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In a statement Monday, Avant denied the district attorney's allegations.</p>
<p>Avant and Cadence have been bitter rivals for years. They both sell software that helps engineers design the intricate layouts of computer chips.</p>
<p>For more than a year, Cadence has been pressing its own civil action against Avant, alleging its rival stole some of its programming codes and used them in its own products.</p>
<p>All of the officials charged were former employees of Cadence Design Systems, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Santa Clara County prosecutors said they have filed felony charges of conspiracy and theft of trade secrets against Avant, its president and director Gerald Hsu, vice president of engineering Stephen Tzyh-Lih Wuu, vice president of technology Yuh-Zen Liao, and director Yun-Chung Eric Cho.</p>
<p>Charges were also filed against Avant employee Chih-Liang Eric Cheng; director of business operations Shiaoli Leigh Huang; and Mitsuru Igusa, according to prosecutors.</p>
