<headline>Leaning a language without going 'loco'.</headline>

<text>
<p>I was in a hotel room, wondering why I had gotten a message warning me that I was in danger, when a detective knocked on the door. When his team of officers checked my briefcase, they discovered a passport that had my picture, but a different name -- Oscar Lake.</p>
<p>Then the detective asked a question that really stumped me: &quot;Que sabe usted del desaparecido dimante azul?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is Oscar Lake?&quot; is a crime mystery where the biggest puzzle is trying to learn the language. Available in Spanish, French, Italian, German and English versions, it places you in a foreign country where you are accused of masterminding a diamond heist. You must find the real culprit and clear your name -- and do it in a foreign language.</p>
<p>Developed by Learning Publications Interactive (Windows/Macintosh, under $80), &quot;Oscar Lake&quot; was designed with the premise that the best way to learn a language is to become immersed in it. Thus, the game wastes no time. It drops you into a train station where strange words echo through the halls and you must figure out where to go and how to get there.</p>
<p>Armed only with an on-line dictionary, your first job is to answer the phone and figure out that the caller is telling you how to meet her. Then you have to buy the right ticket, get into your hotel room, check your messages, inspect the diamond and be prepared when the police come to give you the third degree.</p>
<p>Actually, it's not as hard as it sounds. In addition to the on-line dictionary, &quot;Oscar Lake&quot; has other systems for helping you overcome the language barrier.</p>
<p>When you put your cursor over an object, a click of the mouse identifies it. At the train station, for example, the Spanish version of the game tells you that each bench is &quot;un banco.&quot; In addition, there's a special button that will translate what's been said, and help you make the correct response.</p>
<p>The game also includes drills for learning numbers, weather conditions, time and other things any traveller or language student will need to know. Computer owners with a microphone can record their voice and check their pronounciation.</p>
<p>As a mystery game, &quot;Oscar Lake&quot; is nothing special. Aside from the newsstand clerk who seems to suffer from narcolepsy, the characters aren't particularly interesting. It's easy to move around and the scenery is nice, but there aren't many places to go.</p>
<p>I found several inconsistencies in the plot that some players may find annoying.</p>
<p>After my interrogation by police, the game forced me to tell a friend that the cops &quot;think Amalia Corazon knows something about the missing diamond.&quot; But the detective never mentioned Amalia's name during the questioning.</p>
<p>At another point, my friend asked &quot;Why do the police think you're Oscar Lake?&quot; I had specifically avoided revealing that bit of information.</p>
<p>And toward the end of the game, after I had figured out what was going on and discovered the location of the missing diamond, I tried to give a policeman the key to the place where the diamond was hidden. He wouldn't take it.</p>
<p>The glitches may reflect the fact that solving the mystery is secondary to the job of teaching players over 1,200 words in a new language.</p>
<p>You won't pass as a native during a trip to a foreign capital after you've played &quot;Who is Oscar Lake?,&quot; but at least you won't come across looking like a complete tonto (fool).</p>
<p>    -   -   -   -</p>
<p>Computer programmes are particularly adept at teaching some foreign language skills because they are so patient, willing to keep pace with a student no matter how slow that pace might be.</p>
<p>Some programmes on the market that take a more direct approach to teaching a language include &quot;Practice Makes Perfect Spanish&quot; (from The Learning Company, Windows/Macintosh, $40).</p>
<p>It offers a tutorial on 2,300 practical Spanish words and is designed for beginner or intermediate levels. The Windows version includes a speech-recognition programme to assist in pronounciation and guard against speaking Spanish with a Bronx accent.</p>
<p>The Learning Company also sells &quot;Berlitz Think &amp; Talk Spanish,&quot; with 50 language lessons, a 10,000-word dictionary and 150 real-life simulations. But it's a lot more expensive, with a retail price of $100.</p>
<p>IMSI offers &quot;EZ Language&quot; for $70. It's an updated version of a programme that teaches words and phrases in Spanish, German, Russian, French, Italian and Japanese. Available for both Windows and Macintosh, it's designed for cross-learning, which means that someone who knows Spanish can learn English or any of the other five languages.</p>
<p>Finally, even if you don't plan to travel, computer owners may find &quot;Web Translator&quot; from Globalink helpful. This $50 product for Windows will translate a World Wide Web page from Spanish, French or German. The manufacturer warns that the translation may have some &quot;rough spots.&quot; But because human language continues to be too complex for most software programmes to handle, it's not surprising.</p>
