<title>USA: PeopleSoft stock falls on earnings fears.</title>
<headline>PeopleSoft stock falls on earnings fears.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares of PeopleSoft Inc. fell sharply in heavy trading Wednesday amid investor concerns about the software company's earnings, but the worries may prove unfounded, analysts said.</p>
<p>PeopleSoft, which produces human resource management and financial system software, slid as low as $34 before ending down $3.375 at $36.375 on Nasdaq, where it was among the most active issues.</p>
<p>Investors dumped PeopleSoft shares after Informix Corp. issued a warning late Tuesday about its own performance, raising fears about the industry's fortunes.</p>
<p>But analysts said Informix's woes are not a good barometer of how PeopleSoft will fare this quarter.</p>
<p>Although PeopleSoft's applications run on Informix's database software products, Informix represents a small portion of PeopleSoft's revenues, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is little correlation between PeopleSoft and Informix. The majority of PeopleSoft's application are run on other companies' products,&quot; said Andrew Roskill, an analyst with Smith Barney.</p>
<p>Roskill said rumours circulated throughout the market Wednesday that he had downgraded PeopleSoft's stock. Roskill said this was not true, and he reiterated his outperform rating on the stock to quell the rumours.</p>
<p>Roskill said PeopleSoft appears to be on track for the March quarter. He expects the Pleasanton, Calif.-based company to earn 12 cents a share on revenues of $150 million.</p>
<p>Peoplesoft earned $11.0 million, or 9 cents a share, on revenues of $78.2 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31.</p>
<p>Other analysts agree that PeopleSoft's business fundamentals remain strong.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no problem with PeopleSoft. I don't think anybody should be concerned about the quarter,&quot; said Bert Hochfeld, an analyst with Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross. &quot;I would be very, very surprised if they had a miss this quarter.&quot;</p>
<p>Neil Herman, an analyst with Salomon Brothers, said of the stock's price decline, &quot;It's probably fear, doubt, uncertainty about technology companies and the quarter. But there's nothing in particular going on with PeopleSoft to cause that (stock movement).&quot;</p>
<p>Herman said that as investors become increasingly skittish about technology companies, stocks such as PeopleSoft with high price/earnings multiples have been the hardest hit.</p>
<p>&quot;We're at the point of maximum stress about the quarter. Informix's pre-announcement now has people generally more concerned,&quot; said James Mendelson, an analyst with SoundView Financial Group.</p>
<p>PeopleSoft officials could not be reached for comment.</p>
