<p>Shares of Verity Inc were the NASDAQ market's net loss leader on Friday, tumbling nearly 50 percent at one point after the company said it expected to post a first fiscal quarter loss.</p>
<p>By 1430 EDT stock of the software products maker was down 11-3/8 at 12-3/4, having hit a 52-week low of 12-3/8 earlier.</p>
<p>The company's chairman and chief executive, Philippe Courtot, said in a statement after the market close on Thursday that the company expects to post a loss of about $1.3 million, or 12 cents a share, in its first fiscal quarter ended August 31.  </p>
<p>Wall Street estimates had been for a profit of $0.05 a share for the quarter, which compared to a loss of $0.21 in the year-ago period, according to First Call.</p>
<p>The company also said its first quarter revenues would total around $8.8 million, down from the $10 million it achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996 although up from $5.5 million in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>In response to the news, Alex Brown analyst Mary McCaffrey said she had cut her fiscal 1997 revenue forecast to $41.3 million from $48 million previously and now estimates the company will post a fiscal 1997 loss of $0.24 a share.  </p>
<p>McCaffrey had previously had a fiscal 1997 earnings per share estimate of $0.33 profit.</p>
<p>&quot;They missed the quarter and I have some concerns that there's a lengthening in the sales cycle and expenses are running a little bit higher than I thought,&quot; she told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Usually these things are not a one-quarter event,&quot; she added. The Alex Brown analyst also cut her recommendation on the stock to a &quot;neutral&quot; from a &quot;buy&quot; rating.</p>
<p>Mean estimates for Verity Inc's 1997 fiscal year to the end of May were for earnings per share of $0.37, compared to a loss of $0.23 a share in the year to the end of May, 1996.  </p>
<p>Courtot has been leading an 18 month turnaround of the software company, transforming it into a maker of tools and applications for searching, retreiving and filtering information on the Internet and within organizations.</p>
<p>The company, which completed an initial public offering in October 1995, currently claims more than 800 customers worldwide and employs more than 200 people.</p>
<p>Courtot said in a statement that while disappointed with the quarterly results, Verity's management &quot;...are very confident in the fundamentals of our business and the  potential opportunities of the emerging market for our products.&quot;  </p>
<p>The company said the first quarter loss would compare with a net loss of $436,000, or $0.21 a share, for the same quarter of the prior year and net income of $350,000, or $0.03 a share, for the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Verity said software product revenues are expected to be about $7.2 million, which would represent an increase of 74 percent over the $4.2 million in software product revenues for the year-ago first quarter, but a decrease of about 13 percent compared with the $8.3 million in the quarter to May 1996.</p>
<p>The company said it expects operating expenses for the first quarter will be higher than the prior quarter as a percentage of revenues.</p>
<p>This is due primarily to lower revenues levels and, with respect to research and development expense, increased staff expense principally related to development for introduction of the company's SEARCH'97 product line scheduled for Fall 1996.</p>
