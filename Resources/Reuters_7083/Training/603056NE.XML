<p>Only 80 percent  of British government departments and agencies are confident of adapting their computers in time to avert the so-called millennium threat, the National Audit Office said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It said the types of problems that could arise included salaries not being paid, police records being wiped out, tax collection being put at risk and defence systems malfunctioning.</p>
<p>The millennium threat stems from the possibility that some computer programmes, which express years as a double digit (currently 97), will be flummoxed by a double zero for 2000.</p>
<p>Some computers could simply shut down. Others could produce meaningless results if they assume that 00 comes before 99.</p>
<p>The NAO, an independent watchdog, said in a report that most of the government's information technology managers who responded to a recent survey were aware of the problem and were at the stage of auditing their systems.</p>
<p>But 20 percent were unable to say for sure that they would complete the work needed to guarantee that the wheels of government will keep turning in the year 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;Where doubt was expressed about completion, the issues yet to be resolved were mainly about funding, resource availability, testing and compliance of bought-in products,&quot; the NAO said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a need for managers at all levels to be aware that this is not just a technical issue, but one which can have a profound impact on the ability of the organisation to continue functioning in the next millennium,&quot; the watchdog said.</p>
<p>The NAO said it was impossible for now to estimate the cost of tackling the problem.</p>
<p>&quot;Although in most cases it is fairly simple to modify the way an information system stores dates, the number of modifications needed in most organisations makes this a huge programme to manage,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Some experts have suggested large companies could face a bill of 10 million to 60 million pounds ($16 million to $98 million) each. The U.S. House of Representatives estimated that the cost of modifying the U.S. federal government's computer systems could reach $30 billion. ($1=.6098 Pound)</p>
