<p>Bill Gates, one of the world's richest men, said on Tuesday he does not think much about money and would give his riches away, but not yet.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not somebody who takes a lot of time spending money and thinking about money...,&quot; Gates, who owns 25 percent of Microsoft Corp, the world's biggest software company, said at a news conference in New Delhi.</p>
<p>Later, asked at a business meeting if it was true that he planned to give his riches away, Gates replied: &quot;That's true,&quot; but added, &quot;For quite sometime, that won't be my focus.&quot;</p>
<p>Thousands of people swarmed to see Gates talk on his vision of India as a major software producer, but quite a few were apparently in awe of his wealth. Last December, his Microsoft stake was estimated at $23 billion.</p>
<p>Gates said he had a few decades ahead leading Microsoft before giving money away. &quot;I have a lot of time before I think about that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think I have a great job, it is a fun job,&quot; Gates said.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason I think my job is the best job in the world is because every day I am learning new things and everyday I am working with very smart people.&quot;</p>
