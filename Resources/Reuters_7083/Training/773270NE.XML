<title>USA: Human rights groups favor strong encryption abroad.</title>

<p>Human rights activists came to Capitol  Hill on Friday to tell lawmakers of their need to use strong computer  encoding programs, subject to strict U.S. export limits, in their  work outside the country.</p>
<p>The debate over exports of encryption technology, which scrambles  information and renders it unreadable without a password or software  &quot;key,&quot; has largely pitted the interests of commercial companies and  civil libertarians against those of law enforcement and intelligence  agencies.</p>
<p>But human rights advocates said Friday they also had a critical interest  at stake.</p>
<p>Swift and inexpensive communications over the Internet &quot;promise to  destroy the ability of abusive regimes to silence their people, hide  their atrocities and blockade the truth,&quot; said Dinah PoKempner, deputy  general counsel for Human Rights Watch.</p>
<p>&quot;Encryption offers the most fundamental protection to those who seek  to bring abuses to light in these circumstances,&quot; she added at a briefing  for congressional staff.</p>
<p>Those who report human rights abuses can become victims of abuse if  discovered, so the availability of encryption to hide electronic mail  messages or faxes can be a matter of &quot;life or death,&quot; said Patrick  Ball, who trains human rights activists to use the technology.</p>
<p>The Clinton administration generally prohibits the export of strong  encryption unless the products allow the government to decode any  message by gaining access to the software keys. A variety of encryption-related  legislation is pending in Congress, including bills that would overturn  the Clinton policy and relax the export limits.</p>
<p>Ball, senior program associate with the American Association for the  Advancement of Science (AAAS), warned that the use of so-called key  recovery features to give governments access to coded messages could  compromise the work of human rights groups.</p>
<p>&quot;How can we ensure that intelligence and law enforcement groups in  repressive countries will not directly or indirectly obtain human  rights groups keys from the U.S. government,&quot; Ball asked. &quot;Human rights  monitoring is always defined by repressive regimes as a threat to  national security.&quot;</p>
<p>Congressional staffers attending the briefing also heard from leading  cryptography scientists who said U.S. export controls stifled research  on encryption, thereby slowing the development of more secure computer  networks.</p>
<p>Alex Fowler, project coordinator with the AAAS, said the presentations  were intended to counter the portrait of encryption users painted  by law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to reaffirm that cryptography is a science, not just a pastime  of anarchists, terrorists and hackers,&quot; Fowler said.</p>
<p>The export rules prohibit U.S. researchers from collaborating with  foreign scientists on coding technology, according to Ian Goldberg,  a graduate student at the University of California.</p>
<p>In January, Goldberg sucessfully cracked a message in a few hours  that had been encoded with the most powerful encryption allowed to  be freely exported from the United States.</p>
<p>A Canadian citizen, Goldberg said that he could collaborate with others  or publish research on the Internet while home from school. &quot;But I  can't go home every time I have an idea --the plane fare alone...&quot;  he joked.</p>
