<title>USA: Oracle shares fall after earnings.</title>
<headline>Oracle shares fall after earnings.</headline>

<p>Oracle Corp shares fell as much as 6.1 percent Wednesday after the software company's earnings failed to match Wall Street's more optimistic forecasts.</p>
<p>&quot;They had a fine quarter but they didn't blow out the numbers,&quot; said Joe Farley, a software analyst at investment bank UBS Securities in New York. &quot;A lot of times when tech stocks don't blow their numbers out, they get a backlash.&quot;  </p>
<p>After the market closed Tuesday, Oracle, the world's second-biggest software company, said its fiscal fourth quarter earnings rose 35 percent from a year earlier, to $359.9 million, or $0.54 a share.</p>
<p>That matched Wall Street's consensus forecast, according to First Call, but fell short of some investors' expectations.</p>
<p>Oracle shares were down 2-3/4 at 50-1/2. Earlier, the shares traded as low as 50.</p>
<p>In recent days, talk of huge contracts for Oracle's database and manufacturing software had boosted the stock, analysts said.</p>
<p>Oracle executives would not discuss particular contracts but said they had plenty of business lined up heading to the first fiscal quarter.</p>
<p>The optimistic outlook, however, was overshadowed by growing concerns about flagging revenue in the technology business.</p>
<p>Yesterday, disk-drive maker Seagate Technology Inc and PC company Gateway 2000 Inc said their quarterly earnings will be less than expected because of weak sales.</p>
