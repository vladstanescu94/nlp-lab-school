<text>
<p>Netscape Communications Corp. on Tuesday reported a sharp jump in second-quarter operating income, boosted by the June launch of the Internet software company's SuiteSpot 3.0 and Netscape Communicator products.</p>
<p>Netscape posted operating income of $8.8 million, or 10 cents per share, a 52 percent increase from operating income of $5.8 million, or 7 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>The results, released after markets closed, was in line with Wall Street forecasts.</p>
<p>Operating earnings excluded a one-time charge of $52.6 million related to Netscape's acquisitions of privately held DigitalStyle Corp. and Portola Communications Inc.</p>
<p>Including the charge, Netscape had a net loss of $43.8 million, or 49 cents a share, vs. $906,000, or 1 cent a share, a year ago.    The Mountain View, Calif.-based company</p>
<p>reported an 80 percent rise in revenues to $135.2 million from $75 million in the year-earlier quarter. Revenues were also up 12.5 percent from the first quarter.</p>
<p>Netscape traded at $46 in the after-hours market, up from its closing level of $44.50, a 62.5-cent rise on the day, on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>&quot;This quarter saw Netscape deliver its flagship enterprise products -- SuiteSpot 3.0 and Netscape Communicator -- to resounding acclaim from customers, partners and developers,&quot; Netscape Chief Executive Officer Jim Barksdale said in a statement. &quot;With these new products Netscape has once again proven its competitive edge and reinforced its role as an Internet technology leader.&quot;</p>
<p>Barkesdale noted the company has expanded its focus on large corporate customers and other large organisations, aiming to work more closely with its reseller partners to reach its largest customers more effectively.</p>
<p>Daniel Rimer, an analyst at investment bank Hambrecht &amp; Quist, said the company's revenues were toward the top end of estimates.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it was a very positive quarter across the board,&quot; he said, noting the company had demonstrated it could execute on its plans to put out products across the board.</p>
