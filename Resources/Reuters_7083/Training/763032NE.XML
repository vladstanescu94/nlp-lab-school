<p>Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Explorer browser and other technology will be more tightly integrated with Lotus Notes under an agreement announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>The agreement will give the estimated 12 million users of Lotus Notes access to a well-integrated version of the Microsoft browser, beginning with Notes version 4.6 due out by the end of September.</p>
<p>Officials of International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus unit left the door open to a similar arrangement with Netscape Communications Corp., but the two companies have been feuding recently.</p>
<p>Lotus offered Lotus Notes with Netscape's popular Navigator browser earlier this year but stopped when the upgraded version of the browser was offered only with Communicator, a suite of communications products that competes directly with Notes.</p>
<p>Industry publications have reported in recent weeks that Netscape would unbundle Navigator for IBM, but so far no agreement has been reached, giving Microsoft its opening.</p>
<p>&quot;The collaborative approach between Microsoft and Lotus to make computing easier not only meets the goals of our two companies, but will deliver great benefits to our vast base of shared customers worldwide,&quot; Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said in a news release.</p>
<p>Officials of both companies said no money changed hands in the non-exclusive technology agreement.</p>
<p>Dave Rothschild, director of client product marketing for Netscape, said the company had &quot;an ongoing dialogue&quot; with IBM but so far had no plans to offer the latest version of Navigator as a separate component.</p>
<p>Scott Eliot, a senior product manager at Lotus, said that while both major browsers have advantages, Microsoft's use of software components allowed better integration with Notes.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Lotus compete fiercely in several markets including the lucrative groupware arena, where Microsoft has been trying to develop a strong competitor for years, most recently using its Microsoft Exchange server.</p>
<p>But Eliot said Lotus recognises the importance of supporting standards set by Microsoft, such as its rapidly growing Windows NT system for networks.</p>
<p>&quot;Exchange is totally integrated with NT,&quot; Eliot said. &quot;We want to absolutely be as integrated as well, so we can take that off the table and people can focus on groupware.&quot;</p>
