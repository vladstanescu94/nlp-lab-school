<p>Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown said Thursday analysts should &quot;resist any temptation&quot; to raise their estimates for the company's earnings for the fiscal year that began July 1.</p>
<p>Analysts on average expect Microsoft to earn $3.15 a share, according to First Call, compared with $2.63 for the year just ended.</p>
<p>In a conference call with analysts, Brown gave a laundry list of reasons to be cautious, including expected slower growth in personal computer sales. But he said he was bullish for the long term.  </p>
<p>In the conference call, the company treasurer, Greg Maffei, said Microsoft did not buy back any stock in the latest quarter because &quot;we thought the price was a little high.&quot;</p>
<p>The company had repurchased $3 billion in stock earlier in the fiscal year and plans to continue the buyback program, he said.</p>
<p>Microsoft executives said its high-end Windows NT operating system continues to gain market share. Windows NT now has an estimated 40 percent of the market in Intel Corp servers, up from from 25 percent a year earlier, they said during the call.  </p>
<p>Maffei, who succeeds Brown as CFO this month, said Windows NT Workstation sales nearly tripled in the year.</p>
<p>Windows NT accounted for about 10 percent of last year's $3.48 billion in revenues from computer manufacturers, or OEMs, he said, and that percentage is expected to grow.</p>
<p>Maffei said Windows NT Workstation sales were 29 percent of Windows 95 revenues and 14 percent of Windows 95 units in the latest quarter.</p>
<p>Brown predicted overall pressure on profit margins in the current fiscal year would hold the earnings growth rate close to the company's revenue growth rate.</p>
<p>He said he expected the company's cost of goods sold would be about 9 percent of revenues in the current year, compared with 9.6 percent in the year just ended and 7.6 percent in the latest quarter.</p>
<p>Brown also said the company probably would take a charge against earnings of $0.25 a share in the current quarter and $0.01-$0.02 in the second quarter assuming it completes its planned $425 million acquisition of WebTV Networks Inc.</p>
